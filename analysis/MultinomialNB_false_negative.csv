"god bless 80's slasher films . this is a fun , fun movie . this is what slasher films are all about . now i'm not saying horror movies , just slasher films . it goes like this a high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders , and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong . disfigured and back for revenge , sporting a joker jester mask pretty creepy looking , might i add , marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later , after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion . that is basically the plot ? what's wrong with that ? that's the beauty of 80's slasher films , most of them i would say . a lot of things could be so ridiculous , but they keep drawing you more in an' in as they go by . especially this film . it features some outrageous killings , and some are quite creative as well . poisoning of a beer can , acid bath , i can't remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film either it really is a fun , fun movie . that's all it is . nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots , never mind their stupidity , and never mind the outrageous , random things that occur in this film . such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer when he's not even switching any buttons , you'll see and toilets being able to cough up blood , baths being able to have acid come out of them , just use that as part of your entertainment ! because thats what really makes it entertaining . movies like this represent 80's slashers . never again could movies like this get made , know why ? it isn't the 80's anymore . that is why you should just cherish them for what they are , good fun ! i highly recommend this film if you're a hardcore fan of slahsers such as friday the 13th . one last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well , marty rantzen . a disfigured , nerd , who kills all his old foes in a creepy jester mask . a good villain makes a good slasher . simon scuddamore , who played marty apparently committed suicide shortly after slaughter high was released . that alone adds something creepy to the film , and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the marty character , i guess . all in all , great 80's slashers fun ! it's a shame it will never be the same again .",1,0
"i'm not here to tell you armored is kubrickian , hitchcockian or fellini esquire . nope . referenced directors are more like don siegel charlie varrick and walter hill the warriors . those two helmers didn't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies . no skirts need apply . they unapologetically made guy movies . guns , lots of guns . men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw . their movies were like a sap to the head . you want a friend ? get a dog . armored is so a guy movie . dueling armored trucks ? bloody gunshot wounds ? exploding money ? if that doesn't get the lizard part of your brain excited , then stay away . at 88 minutes , armored is all muscle without an ounce of fat . we meet six security guards who drive armored trucks , three per truck . the six , led by matt dillon , scheme up a fake hijack involving two trucks . their mission one day is to deliver 42 million from the federal reserve i think . the idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse , stash the cash , then stage a hijack . sure , the cops will suspect them , but if they stick together they'll get through it . trouble is , one of the six , played by columbus short , is a holdout . at first . but he faces eviction . and he's the guardian for his messed up younger brother . he needs cash bad . matt dillon cajoles , pleads , persuades the holdout . no blood on anyone's hands . a clean getaway . all good , no bad . you'll be rich forever . blue skies smiling at you . right . everything goes to hell , of course . it's one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up . and it almost all happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in los angeles . in fact , the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay . i happen to like industrial urban decay . kudos to matt dillon , who plays the top bad dog . he goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally effing insane in the course of the movie . love that guy . also , credit is due to the menacing , throbbing , blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by john murphy . i am guessing he's heard a few tangerine dream records . also , it's surprising that this is a pg 13 movie . i caught one one ! f bomb in this entire movie about violent tough guy robbers . on some level , i like that . take the kids . the director is nimrod antal , a hungarian who made a fine noir set in the budapest subway system called kontroll . screenwriter is an out of nowhere guy called james v . simpson . a lot of the people in this movie are just starting out . i am willing to bet the esteem given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers .",1,0
"this movie probably had a 750 budget , and still managed to surpass titanic . i rented this the day i crashed my mom's car , and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief ! it has to be tied with 'the assult of the killer bimbos' . things to look for are 1 . the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 . the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 . the flinstone like screech out driving 4 . the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed don't worry , i'm not ruining any surprises , for it's soooo predictable 5 . the guy who finds it necessary to howl . 6 . the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen . 7 . the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest . 8 . the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall . 9 . last , but not least , the wonderful special effects especially the stab in the boob that made a . heaven help me . popping noise . enjoy !",1,0
"as far as christian film goes , it's typical . lacking of a mega budget they try their best . some times falling short , sometimes hitting the mark . this one almost hit , great acting can only carry a movie so far . a combining of h . p . lovecraft , and frank peretti was a good idea . all's it needed was better back story , and better character development to make it great movie . the visuals are not that bad , also smart holding off the demons till the last few minutes helped keep the suspense at a good pace . could of used a better ending though . not a bad premise having terrorists experiments go wrong . much better than typical hollywood treatment about the demonic realm . maybe someone will finally do this present darkness as a movie .",1,0
"wow , how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes ? it was surely the highlight of my year nay my life . as if the raptor graphics weren't amazing enough , the award winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie , even when the background didn't actually match up with the setting of the scene . wow , what genius . and while the movie is full of plot holes for instance , a few clips of a t rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where pappy finds a torture chamber , screams colin's a girl ! and runs out i will never forget the brilliance that is raptor planet . thank you sci fi for another classic .",1,0
"that kid a is such a babe ; this movie was no titan a . e . of which it is in many ways modeled after but still came off as entertaining , the fact this lost to a piece of monkey crap like tomb raider makes wanna cry ; includes some of the most entertaining characters i've seen in disney film",1,0
i read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad . i think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies . if you are not a person that enjoyed the waltons or little house . u will not understand nor enjoy these movies . now about loves abiding joy . i knew he was bad news from the start of the movie . i wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it . this movie has a lot to do with jeff . it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in girls . i want to say that i have enjoyed all 4 movies so far . was not crazy about the books . cant wait until the next movie . the way clark talks will get you every time . i would love to see january jones do an appearance . maybe a family reunion or something .,1,0
"okay okay , i must admit , i do somewhat like peter liapis and i'll admit this is not the best ghoulies sequel . i mean , yeah , it had its flaws , such as no ghoulies themselves . but the two ghoulies that come to earth were really funny , i guess they were called , dark and lite . i enjoyed the plot of the movie . and even at the end of the movie both ghoulies implied that there would be a sequel . still waiting . lol . peter liapis reprised his role as jonathan graves , this time playing a detective , how cute ! ghoulies iv may not be scary or suspenseful , but it is definitely funny . i thought i would comment on this movie and just say it's not that bad . it is worth watching even though the ghoulies aren't in it .",1,0
"born again is a okay episode of season 1 . the reincarnation bit , in my opinion , is cool . the more i watch it , the more i like it , yet it will never rise above 'very good' for me . even though it is not very memorable , i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode . anyway , now i will say what is good and bad about this episode , the good oragami . oh yeah ! that fish tank was nice . thrown out of a window . very classy . x the bad marry your best friend's wife ! ? o o what a random pick to reincarnate . why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up , try to take his scarf off instead ? conclusion okay episode , not very memorable . 7 10",1,0
"hmmmm , want a little romance with your mystery ? this has it . i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie . but how could the romance be ditched when the story's borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel , whatever the heck that is . had the romance been ditched , the story might have been a little too weak . the mystery here wasn't too bad , quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage . oh well . i thought mel harris was pretty good ; her short skirts , i think , added some sex appeal . but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast , maybe with a more well known tv movie actor . the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on both could have been a little edgier , a little darker , more adventurous . one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations . that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest . possibly a drawback was the director and or cinematographer's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect . not good . had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen , picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background . this was just a tv movie , though , so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery . overall , twasn't really a bad movie . i'll tell you what , this was absolutely the best canadian hungarian production i have ever seen ! and the only that i know of . i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made for tv movie , giving it a grade of c",1,0

"this is the funniest sequel i have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary . it has some very gory pieces in the film , but not bad enough to make you sick . in this one he has a female doll companion , hence the name . if you liked the first three then you'll love this , go watch it !",1,0
"personally , i enjoyed cut thouroughly . it was the first time i've seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick . a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films . with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything . i didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies . it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street , not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief . i think it's about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres . cut was original , scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun . i'd give it seven out of ten and wouldn't treat it as anything serious . it did what i expected it to do , entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying . i enjoyed it .",1,0
"a series of shorts spoofing dumb tv shows , groove tube hits and misses a lot . overall , i do really like this movie . unfortunately , a couple of the segments are totally boring . a few really great clips make up for this . a predecessor to such classics like kentucky fried movie .",1,0
"i found this film to be the usual french slap in america's face . the camera , all too often , focuses on fat people , on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas . while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer , the cinematography exploits and demeans them . there were , undoubtedly , thin people to be seen in glencoe and neat , organized homes , but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen . i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements . i can assure you , as a frequent visitor to france , that all is not well there . foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated , thus creating severe social inequities . but americans are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the u . s . , so we're not likely to see films on the subject .",1,0
"i waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when i first saw it over 10 years ago , i wanted to think carefully about what i wanted to write . i found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary . it did what it set out to do , show me something i had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored . i knew nothing of the drag world and finding out about them and the balls was just spectacular to me . these folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it , for competition . the catty folks , the complainers even i was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen was wearing wasn't a man's coat ! , the jealous , it's all there like in every other competition . like every other competition like it . which i felt was a point . you had the older drag queen talking about how the balls used to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories and even those who looked on knowing that the future of balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway . it was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete , it was that important to them ! then there was sad stories , stories of who's house and house mother brought out the best and the brightest in competition . it was interesting . now to add after 10 years of seeing this film , i lived through the so called 'madonna' craze . i spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with madonna during her vogue phase and rightfully so . if not for those individuals , madonna wouldn't have had a vogue phase , i know that now . credit should be given where credit is due . makes me wonder , if anyone else from mainstream america would watch this documentary , they'll learn they're not as mainstream as they think .",1,0
"an enjoyable movie , without a doubt , and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage' . but i have to say that having read the very positive comments here , i was a bit disappointed . the period was captured , but the plot was desperately thin . the whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays . the idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns , but a philanderer , is risible . and without that , nada . the sub plots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story which surely suggests a fundamental flaw . when all your sub plots look like padding , you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits . nevertheless , it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place , there are some fine performances , and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final 'cut ! ' that good feeling permeates the film . and that has to count for something . a flawed really quite good movie . 7 out of 10 .",1,0
"after seeing the 'oh so acclaimed' fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average , i was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another coen 'masterpiece' . this time i was much less disappointed than i was with fargo and i must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of george clooney . well done mr . clooney , make more of these and less 'perfect stormish' movies . you can act and you showed it here . 7 out of 10",1,0

"watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s , a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as die hard in a on a . cliffhanger is die hard on a mountain , and pretty good , for what it is . but unlike passenger 57 and under siege , which are decent die hard clones on their own terms , cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that , in their immensity , threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks . years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations , cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings . the opening sequence has already received substantial praise , all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening . not even harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal , which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in deep blue sea , or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite's face , can dim the sequence's power . the next impressive set piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet . as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin , the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody double crosses are completely unexpected . as roger ebert has observed , the stuntman who made the mid air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition . later , during the avalanche sequence , one of the terrorists thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain . so far as i know , no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle , considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts , so obviously a dummy was used for the shot . but the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how harlin or more likely one of the second unit directors knew exactly where to place the camera . i'll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week , because he's one of the few movie stars i've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain , and at the same time actually feels that pain . the role of gabe walker really complements stallone's acting strengths he plays an older , more vulnerable kind of action hero , giving an impressively low key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself . in contrast to many of today's post matrix , comic book inspired action heroes , stallone's walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer enhanced abilities . in cliffhanger , the hero almost freezes to death , and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another . he winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut , particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky style pummeling from one of the mad dog villains . it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness when i first saw this movie as a teenager , i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather , the ice ; at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise . lithgow's british accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter , but he's fundamentally a good actor , and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene , looking at his hostages stallone and rooker , trying to decide which tasks to give them , he actually says you , stay ! you , fetch ! even a better actor , such as anthony hopkins , might have had trouble with that line . even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside , it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show . early in the movie , for example , lithgow openly says to one of his men retire stallone when he comes down . no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face , and this precipitates a gripping tug of war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg . lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means , but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor . done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or at times a western , cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film . besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before , the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow , as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action packed narrative . finally , harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless , since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes . it's a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies , because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later . but perhaps it's best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time , without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already . there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit compared to that clinker , cliffhanger belongs on the imdb's top 250 list . rating 8 very good , especially considering most of stallone's other movies .",1,0
"no , this hilariously horrible 70's made for tv horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake . still , this exceptionally awful , yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute , unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so execrable it's downright awesome sort of way . richard crenna , looking haggard and possibly inebriated , and yvette mimieux , who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in jackson county jail , sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint , dull , sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit . pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann the psychic alien moppets from the disney witch mountain pictures are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty , ugly canine entity in the den . boy , now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing ? well , scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't , but it sure is funny , thanks to curtis night tide harrington's hopelessly weak direction , cartoonish not so special effects , an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot , and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story besides the leads , both martine beswicke and r . g . armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman . favorite scene the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna , practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade . while stuck up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock , devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo .",1,0
"ok , so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers , but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted , right ? right ! consider yourselves officially warned , and read on . in this parody tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history the 1980's a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious murder mcgee , who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard . as i'm sure you can guess , things go from bad to worse faster than you can say where's the beef ? and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody , the dialogue is cheesy , and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get . good times . no clique or 80's horror movie clich d characterizations are left unrepresented here . in fact , no stone was left unturned at all we have the cool hero , his innocent girlfriend , the goth chick , the tough thug think john bender , the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt , the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt , a couple of gorgeous half naked lesbians , and two big geeks . as you can plainly see , the cast is pretty big . usually , larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly , with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel . not in this case though . not a single cast member left me disappointed . the acting was very well done . everyone from the cool hero in his thriller jacket played by jovan meredith to the grooovy goth chick played by renee dorian to geeks one two played by cory assink jonathan brett they all played it straight , brought their a game , and knocked it out of the park . if you're a fan of gary wyatt in weird science , you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks . director co writer jeff c . smith is a guy to watch for in the future , trust me on this . if this is what he can do with a low budget , there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects . the characters were dead on ; the atmosphere was perfect ; the laughs were huge ; the blood flowed , and squirted , and sprayed beautifully it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980's . call this one the breakfast club meets night of the demons ! the tag line says it all , and says it honestly excessive violence ; gratuitous nudity ; zero budget no false advertising here , folks ! as fans of this genre , we have to look to the indies and support these hard working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales , lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered down pg 13 'horror' or pointless remakes like the hitcher . no , thank you no more of that for me . in closing , i honestly have to say that stupid teenagers must die ! is by far one of the best indie flicks i've gotten the pleasure of watching this year . it's a bloody good time , and holds up on repeat viewings . from the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe . even the closing love theme over the end credits which if that doesn't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid 80's power ballads by reo speedwagon over pronounced r's on every word starting with the letter 'r' then i'll eat my dvd right now . bottom line is , if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general , no more hesitation this flick deserves to be in your collection !",1,0
"i would like to start by saying i can only hope that the makers of this movie and it's sister film the intruder directed by the great unheralded stylist auteur that is jopi burnama know in their hearts just how much pleasure they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north eastern town of jarrow . from the opening pre credit sequence which manages to drag ever so slightly despite containing a man crashing through a window on a motorbike , the pitiless destruction of a silence lab , the introduction of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anaemic bad guys in movie history and costume design that jean paul gautier would find ott and garish . make no mistake ; this is a truly unique experience . early highlight an explosion get used to it , plenty more where that came from ! followed by a close up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word dad in living memory . and then . the theme song . yeah , this deserves its own paragraph . sung by aj , written by people who really should wish to remain anonymous , it makes the songs written for the rocky films sound like schubert . this is crap 80's hero motivation narcissism at an all time high , with choice lyrics such as its only me and you , its come down to the wire and much talk of having to cross the line it'll make sense in time our hero cares little for the boundaries of bona fida police work abounding . not to mention the indonesian supremes cooing the film's title seductively . at this point anyone wishing to switch off officially has no pulse . our hero is semitic cop peter goldson essayed brilliantly by intruder star peter o'brien , the stabilizer of the title . the man's bull in a china shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his less than inconspicuous undercover work truly leaves much to be desired , but he is without question an entertaining guide through the mean streets of downtown jakarta , with local sleaze ball connection captain johnny in tow , as well as peter's own waste of space partner in fashion crime sylvia nash , who does little . so many highlights , so little time the slide please arrogance of peter's not all too convincingly argued case against chief baddie greg rainmaker intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard craig gavin as the monstrous john white helluva name eh ? no ! oh well . , the x marks the spot location map stupidity , our hero taking horrible advantage of heroine tina probost during a moment of weakness on her behalf , the latter turning up at a sting operation dressed like a member of a particularly flamboyant dancing troop . and believe me that barely covers it . there wasn't even time to go into the plot revolving around the hunt for a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride . or our hero turning up at a funeral dressed as if an extra on boogie nights . or the absolutely hysterical craic between captain johnny and goldson two guys have never made more heavy weather of buddy buddy shtick than these clowns . the trowel was possibly too subtle me thinks . ah it tails off people , and you never thought scenes of wanton destruction and general mayhem could be so unbelievably boring , but the character interaction is stupendous , the dialogue truly priceless and the incompetence on show somehow endearing . oh and the shoes people watch out for the shoes !",1,0
"this is actually a groovy neat little flick , made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness . it takes a little while to warm up to it . the acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen like charm . after a few scenes , you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries . the characters all develop a quirky charm , especially richard . forget anthony hopkins , maidens is the guy i'd hire to play a raving psychopath . he just seems to enjoy it so very much ! mixed in with the scenes of mad slasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character , the midnight skater zooming through the campus in a black hoodie , looking for all the world like a cross between the grim reaper and , say , the silver surfer . these shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the skater seem almost ominous . the soundtrack features some very fun garage punk tunes and the raspy , raucous meanness of it meshes well with the film's mood . thumbs upish , i say .",1,0
"i liked this movie . no one i know likes it , but i do . i didn't like it as much as the first one but it was still good . the script and plot may not have changed at all , but the story was better than caddyshack 1 . the only reason i didn't like caddyshack 2 is . no rodney dangerfield ! i think the movie would be better if rodney dangerfield had jackie mason's part . although i did like jackie mason in the movie , it would be alot better if they kept rodney dangerfield . another flaw in the movie , that i didn't hate as much , was dan akroyd . the movie was done 8 years after the first one . bill murray , carl , could've quit his job as an assistant greenskeeper and joined the military , you know ? if warner bros . had thought of that , it could've made the movie better , also . this was my comment for caddyshack ii . i give it 8 . 2 out of 10 it could've been better , but good nonetheless . if you've seen caddyshack 1 and are debating on whether or not to see caddyshack 2 , i say give it a try .",1,0
"'blade' would be an extremely above average comic book , vampire hunter action horror if it weren't for two minor flaws . 1 i loved seeing the all but invincible blade snipes do his slicing and dicing , but the whole yes ! fist punch was literally a letdown . 2 bad , no make that horrible , cgi even for 1998 standards . this is mainly in the last third , but some sprinkled throughout . okay , despite those minor infractions , i really enjoyed this movie . all actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'matrix' rip off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior . so maybe 'the matrix' copied 'blade . ' at any rate , it's a very movie for multiple genre loving audiences comic book geeks , action fanatics and horror vampire lovers . so , we have blade , half man half vampire , or day walker and his accomplish , whisler a la batman and alfred battling the undead who , apparently almost out number humans . who knew ? in a rare act of humanity blade's more of an antihero our sword ninja vamp rescues a newly infected coincidentally blood specialist doctor . meanwhile , trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants you guessed it supreme power and needs blade somehow to obtain it . it's not the most original concept , if you read what i just wrote , but still highly enjoyable . you will want to see blade succeed , you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms . and you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1 2 3 of a comic book introduction movie . still , watch this without trying to go too deep . such as vampire spf 1000 suntan lotion ? really ? what about the scalp ? wouldn't that still burn ? just like the money they burn for weapons ? uh , okay , i am going too deep . once again , sit back and enjoy the techno charged fun ride .",1,0
"these slasher pics are past their sell by date , but this one is good fun . the valentine cards themselves are witty , and well thought out . the film has one peach of a line . he's no angel . when he in fact is angel ! watching buffy reruns will never be the same ! the cast is a sizzling display of young talent , but the story does not give them enough real depth . denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters . sorry but no ! the direction is very good , managing to show very little actual gore , and relying on your imaginations implied threat . much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes . essentially , the main directorial plus , lies within the borrowing of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks . psycho's shower scene is tributed , along with halloween's masking . murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know ! light viewing , not very scary but a few good jump moments . if it was a choice between the hole and this though , choose the hole . slasher movies have had their day , and this is just another slasher . a very good slasher , but nothing groundbreaking !",1,0
"got this the other day from the creators on dvd . i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel , had never heard anything about it . after reading it was filmed on balmedie beach i just had to buy it . i used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in aberdeen . 1st off im not a big sci fi fan baring star wars i was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location , i was presently surprised . this didn't turn out to be a standard sci fi , more like a mix of sci fi and survival horror . had a good storyline , which was different , had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with 8000 . acting was better than average for a low budget film . the way they have edited out the whole coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was nice . weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in invisibe mode . all in all i will buy any future releases from these guys , maybe a all out horror next hint hint . the extras on the dvd were very informative on giving background for the producers , i would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next dvd release . excellent work keep it up",1,0
"good film . tells a boyish fantasy story , telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently . or at least the feeling that you have to break every rule if you are to break one . if you wanted to express love for someone you don't know , how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation ? also it's about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life , of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats . what gives disney or fox or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice . are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self . do we have to listen to the nrj shouting , see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee ?",1,0
"i would like to submit the following goof . during the bridge scene , soldiers are seen wading out in the river , asking to be taken away and seeking to escape . some of the soldiers approach captain willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases . soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone . they have duffel bags , packs and footlockers but not suitcases . the use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping . additionally , if you look closely , you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water . this is probably a very good indication that it is empty , otherwise it would sink .",1,0
"these things have been floating around in my head for damn near 10 years now . some pieces of this work were really memorable . id love to see another more current example of cg showy offy stuff . actually i'd love to be part of it . if i'd would of had the chance to just say what i wanted and thats it , i wouldn't have to write all this extra in order to make 10 lines if text as this website requires . i mean really ? this almost discourages me , i mean luckily for the guys that made the movie i really liked the minds eye and it took me 3 times to have enough lines , i hope you don't get me on the misspelling . yup you did .",1,0
"i know what you're saying , oh man , pinochio is not scary ! but this movie goes beyond alot more than a maniacal pinochio . behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is oddly attached to her doll pinnochio who seems to talk to her . the only weird thing is that noone else can hear the doll except her . in the end is shocking revelation that , as did i , will shock you . watch it . give it a try .",1,0
"this movie is kind of good . it seem that they used the tyrannosaurus rex like a blown up balloon , just like godzilla , just maybe back in those 60 70's days , scientist haven't got enough info . on all sorts of dinosaurs . back in those time scientist still making dinosaur , so i guess this movie was base on a tyrannosaurus rex movements back in the 60 70's . there even a part where a giant rock , fired by someone at the tyrannosaurus rex , it damage the tyrannosaurus rex and it was knock out for a little while . at the end , the tyrannosaurus rex went back to search for food . there is something wrong in the movie as well , like a rifle , how can one rifle kill a tyrannosaurus rex , when it could be 1 , 000 5 , 000 stronger than we are . if this film going to make a remake , i suggest make it more good and excited , because watching a old movie seems like to have a remake of it , if lucky .",1,0

"you'd be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie especially one entirely located inside a us prison see this to prove yourself wrong ! it was produced in the 80's after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to 100m budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind ! being mr harlin's first major production and the at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar cast . i still think most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard's screen appearances not mentioning the well overrated mr s bergman directorial efforts at least for all female viewers but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense . do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror puff , imo it's definitely worth it !",1,0

"skippy from family ties goes from clean cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie . the film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave using skippy to help out . and while the plot is corny and cliche , the corniness for example , an evil green fog taking off a girl's clothes and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious and great . and of course , there's nothing like ozzy osbourne playing a preacher who's asking what happened to the love song . definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh . and while you're at it , make it a double feature with slumber party massacre 2 there's an evil rocker as stated on the video box driller killer in black leather w fringe . a must see for cheesy movie fans .",1,0
"we start all of our reviews with the following information . my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . the point of this is that critics count for zero . your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not . therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! we never ever listen or read the critics . we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . well enough about that . this movie is very good . not just good but very good . the critics are a bunch of morons . just because there is nudity and language they hated it . it was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for . is that not right ? every movie cannot be an academy award nominee . sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want",1,0
"this movie is a riot . i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies . i've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny . but this one is wall to wall great lines . i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in . the movie was non stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up . other than that it's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations . i'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around . you have to see it two or three times to get it all in . as far as the actual film goes , it could have used a better edit , it's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that . all the characters are great . it's not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke . i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable . no victims in this movie . also , thank god they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend . catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film . you just wish that women like her really existed . she's not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite . if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it . i assure you , the trailer does not do it justice . they do not give away all the good jokes . just some of the mediocre ones . oh and one more thing . i hope critics put this on their top ten list . many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list . this means you ebert !",1,0
"while possibly the stupidest , most tasteless , and violent slapstick comedy ever made , guest house is also a very funny one . don't listen to the critics , they have no sense of humour . while the climax runs out of steam but not vomit , it's still a funny party movie . seven candles in the eye out of ten .",1,0

"aaah . the thing . to see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty , but distinctly unattractive , makes a refreshing change , and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters , rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover . and carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over styled parodies . and there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending , or cameo celebrity appearance , or lame pseudo romantic subplot . and i really miss on set physical effects ; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics . in the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw alien , the elephant man , poltergeist , the howling , an american werewolf in london , the thing , the company of wolves , a nightmare on elm street . what an era for horror effects ! and don't get me started on the death of matte painting . the matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless . what do we have now ? third rate cgi , former music video directors and professional stylists , that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy mtv videos . now i'm going to go netflix 'the howling' .",1,0

"i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening . i gathered from the ads that it was a thriller . what we have is like compulsion meets matlock . two teens decide to commit a perfect murder . a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual murderers is found . then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander . innocent of the murder anyway enter sondra bullock as the investigating officer . imdb says that she's fbi , but i don't remember that . i thought that she was a regular cop she's frustrated by the inconsistency of the killers profile the profile doesn't fit the profile ! and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys . she's also has demons of her own which figure prominently in her decicision to become a cop . but this is the only character that is really more than one dimensional . all others are pretty flat . for a thriller , there are really no big thrills . it's mostly a cat and mouse game like an episode of matlock which she's watching at one point in the film . the twist is that there are two involved in the killing . just who is the real murderer , justin or richard ? it'll cost you eight bucks to find out .",1,0
"slaughter high is , perhaps , the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s . it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout . that being said , it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown . the reason why slaughter high stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over the top . marty , the killer , has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates . they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room shower , jabbed at his crotch with a javelin , and , to top it off , rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him . so , the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get . when they reunite years later at a high school reunion put on by marty himself you realize they haven't matured all that much . they're a bunch of sociopaths . it is mind boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion , which , by the way , is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair . and who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers as well as marty's on display ? there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film . the ending makes little or no sense . and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fool's day works the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon . in all , the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre , despite all of its flaws . it is hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to dvd , when so many other run of the mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions .",1,0
"the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in . people come looking for a b grade horror film , or a so bad it's good movie . jack frost 2 is neither of these . it is , to put it simply , a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one . to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless scary movies combined is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level . it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions . the premise is simple ; the characters from the first movie , haunted by memories of jack frost , take a vacation to a tropical island . a new , improved jack comes after them , now with essentially the powers of hydro man from spider man ; essentially , he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly , divide himself , multiply himself , and , worst of all , he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness . antifreeze . what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost a simply horrible movie can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel . just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action , jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre . most of the entertainment comes the live action actors , who serve admirably . particularly funny among them are ray tooney playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s , christopher allport offering an insane , hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film , and david allen brooks taking the once serious role of manners to new , totally bizarre heights . the lack of memorable quotes disturbs me . as a horror movie , jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman , rates a zero . but you have to understand , it's not a horror movie .",1,0
"sure , it seems like there is only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode , but it is certainly fun to watch . you might find yourself cringing in your chair as buddy sticks his foot in his mouth and gets shot down , or chuckling and shaking your head when some ridiculous line actually works . the panel of hosts have more of a good natured , friendly dare i say canadian style of commentary compared with cutthroat us reality programming . i think the people who complain about this show don't get the joke . they are taking the show more seriously than the show takes itself . keys to the vip is a great caricature of reality shows , sports tv culture , and the club scene . i hope they do another season , and i'd be interested to see if a us version appears . it's certainly a fun , original premise .",1,0

"if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated , you'll enjoy d war . if you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films , you'll enjoy d war . otherwise , don't bother ! i saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends . they really loved it and that made me feel good . after the movie was over , all the kids my nephews and their friends could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater . the cg is good . acting and directing are horrible . storyline is extremely simple . but , since the half of the audience was kids , they were screaming , shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen . this made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been . it's a good movie to take your kids to , but except for the final battle sequence , d war is disappointing . i give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much .",1,0
"i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it . it actually exceeded my expectations . considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well made film . the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways , especially given the plot . just like the blair witch project , this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film . another bonus whereas most low budget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocre to unintentionally hysterical acting , this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters , particularly the two leads . the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline . it borrows heavily from better known films like deliverance and wrong turn but if you're like me , films of this nature never cease to be terrifying . plus , the director keeps things interesting throughout . i'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out .",1,0
"okay , i know that's clich . taken on its surface , this is a bad film perhaps in a league with plan 9 from outer space . the dialog is suspect but the singlish is quite enjoyable . , the plot is not quite believable , gavin's character overacts excessively . while watching the movie , somethings happen that truly make you wonder . handsome and kim making out on a tank , gwen eating a banana in a bath , just about everything gavin says and does psssssssssssssssycho ! . these things taken separately are perhaps flaws . taken together , however , they are merely quirks . watching this movie with an open mind especially if you're not familiar with singaporean culture , and with an open minded group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughs and a memorable time . you can't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece , or even expecting to take anything serious at all . if you can take this film for what it is an underdog film about underdogs , filled to the brim with its own quirks then you should have a good time watching this one ! i've already seen it three times and i wouldn't hesitate to watch it three more times !",1,0
"sunny , a cocktail waitress in the d . c . area , is a bit dim , to put in mildly . she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple . however , she saves the life of a prominent arab , by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official . she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks . sniffing an opportunity , presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the u . s . government . even then , she messes things up at times , but she tries hard and learns a lot . she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official . but , is there another sinister plot in the making , involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife ? a blonde one ? lol , lol , lol . this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb as a fox , as they say . sunny learns her way around the jungle of the u . s . government very , very well . she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings . perhaps , the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work , but for those who like to laugh , rent this today .",1,0
"i only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much . pornography has a useful purpose in society can't say i can always think of one but it probably does . personal viewpoints set aside , i really thought this film was pretty funny . i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography , i bought it because i am one of those 'alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'alice in wonderland' . i own just about every version there is on dvd so it was an obvious choice to complete my dvd collection with this . i must admit i was scandalized beyond my expectations , and the whole thing would have been thoroughly offensive if it hadn't been so damned funny . besides , the music is really good and i like musicals . not everyone can make a good nudie musical . anyone that has seen 'the first nudie musical' knows what a stink bomb that was . considering what a low budget bill osco worked with , 'alice' is pretty remarkable as a musical it's better than some musicals made on costly budgets . the film can't totally escape the dirtiness of porn . i usually watch the xxx version for full shock effect and some of those scenes are scandalizing scandalizing because we are talking about lewis carroll . i found myself feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where 'alice' kristine debell starts masturbating . it made me feel like a voyeur . and the gratuitous lesbian scenes with 'alice' and the kitty cats were a bit too racey . the film has a great sense of humor about everything however . there is one especially funny moment during the queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says who do i have to f k to get out of this movie ? . hilarious . i'm not sure i buy the whole sex is good for you ball your brains out philosophy here , but sex is human , and nothing human disgust me . i don't know if i really feel that way , but i couldn't resist saying it some people think everything should be about sex . i dunno . jeez , just show some frick'in responsibility and decorum . this movie definitely scores points for the sex minded , but i wouldn't push your luck , next time you might really freak someone out . i mean we are dealing with children's literature here .",1,0

"we start all of our reviews with the following information . my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . the point of this is that critics count for zero . your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not . therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! we never ever listen or read the critics . we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . well enough about that . when meryl streep the head of the nsc in the movie says the united states does not torture it got a big laugh at this movie . it is of course a lie that the bush administration has denied time and again . it is a very good movie and it is scary in what they can do to us as we lose all of our civil rights . they can simply snatch you anywhere and tell know one that they have done it . in this case , they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9 11 . he is of course just like you or i . and so they take him to a secret location outside of the us to torture and waterboard him . very frightening . well acted by jake and reese and the entire cast .",1,0

"this would definitely not have been my kind of movie , but my husband saw it on tv and said it was really good . so , on his recommendation , i bought a copy , since i didn't know if it would ever be on tv again . i had never heard of anybody in it except armand assante . at first i had a hard time getting into the story , because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images and it doesn't make much sense . it is only later in the movie that it all comes together . the scene cutting if that's what it's called , is a bit jarring it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene , and the scenes are jerky but i guess that was done to add to the unusualness if that's a word . the story veers here and there , and just about the time you have it all figured out , everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not . or bad woman . the acting is very good i kept thinking how much norman reedus looks like leo decaprio . the ending was a real twist , totally unexpected , which i liked . a good show .",1,0
"how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this ? i can't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint . i was reminded so often of other movies , it became a big distraction . one of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 day after tomorrow . one line by itself , is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk . but . see the movie ! despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever . while borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard . in fact , you'll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out . why ? . costner and kutcher played their characters very well . i have never been a fan of kutcher's and i nearly gave up on him in the guardian , but he surfaced in good fashion . costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of costner's ability . i don't think mrs . robinson had anything to do with his success . the supporting cast all around played their parts well . i had no problem with any of them in the end . but some of these characters were used too much . from here on out i can only nit pick so i will save you the wear and tear . enjoy the movie , the parts that work , work well enough to keep your head above water . just don't expect a smooth ride . 7 of 10 but almost a 6 .",1,0

well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems . being a self confessed horror fan i sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect . after 2 or 3 mins i actually found myself scared quite rare . the film obviously has a small budget and is set around charing cross station but the films lack of money does not distract from the story . yes the story is a bit far fetched and doesn't explain itself very well but the creep is a class act and proceeds to slash and dismember anything that comes its way . message for ladies ! there are certain parts of the film you should close your eyes at or at least cross your legs ! you will understand when you see it . all in all a good film and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that actually scares,1,0

"this movie's origins are a mystery to me , as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it . i assume that before starship troopers , killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network , cable , or otherwise . the new title of kill shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence , the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema . the quick cuts , cheesy melrose place music , and short 2 second close up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for . and i don't mind at all . i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers an excellent book , in my opinion , not so hot a movie but that's another review . after looking it up on imdb , my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career see bond girl and wild things references here . they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r rated status coveted in suspense video rental sections , that is . in any event , they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense softcore porn section . all in all , it's entertaining . i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a tv pilot , though . that was the biggest pull while watching it when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show , the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual . would i rent it again ? no . would i watch this tv show ? well , why not it's better than baywatch . and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s . token black guy who's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter racial dating , token asian japanese , i assume from the name koji more adept at science and computers than talking to women , beautiful , intelligent latina pre med student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account this show probably would have done ok . but as a movie it just cracks me . i gave it a 7 out of 10 , considering what it was and what it was forced to become . it made for a very enjoyable evening , and that's all i ask of rentals .",1,0

"i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie . for instance , the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could hollywood just throw in a token gay character in the movie . and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great . one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top . and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters . for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible . but i guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad . but if you're more open minded and i don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film .",1,0
"jack frost 2 , is probably the most cheesiest movie i have ever seen in my life . the complete title of the film , is jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman . horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines , will be delighted to watch this . this film was straight to video , and for good reasons . here's why the acting , was so atrocious , and so terrible , that it could cause one to cry . the main character had no personality , and the actor's bad acting made it all worse . the screenplay was , was also atrocious . each character always says a cheesy line , and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography , then you have something bad . second , the story line isn't really all that impressive , but since this movie was straight to video , it is forgiven . the director , and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman , into something cool , but they didn't . they story has lots of plot holes in it . in the beginning , a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank , with the melted jack frost . scientists try to restore his life , but they couldn't . once the cup of coffee fell into the tank , jack frost was completely restored . now he is immune to anti freeze . in jack frost part 1 , the main character's dna got mixed up with the anti freeze that was used to kill jack frost . since the main character is allergic to bananas , jack frost is too . hence , here's my point . they say that sam's dna combined with jack frost's . but , one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup , so when it fell into the tank , the scientists dna would have been combined with jack frosts . another thing , the special effects weren't very good either . here's the good points jack frost 2 has lots of blood , that looks pretty realistic . even though this movie is flawed to hell , it is still entertaining . overall , jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie . the first one was better though . 7 out of 10 .",1,0

"this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in abbott and costello meet frankentstein . it was a somewhat desparate , yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man , frankenstein's monster , and dracula one last time . i say desparate , because in the previous film , house of frankenstein , both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the sunlight , and the wolf man by a silver bullet . yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation . this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn't be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein , and if the wolf man didn't get cured . then there'd be no plot holes . but since this is not the case , the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense . however , ignoring these plot holes , house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch . it has many high points . especially seeing the wolf man get cured . i know i just said that this shouldn't have been included , but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time . and the scene with the lady playing moonlight senada , on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula's spell was very eerie . dr . edleman's transformation into the dr . jekyl mr . hyde type character was also done very well . and it's great to see dracula , frankenstein , and the wolf man together , one last time . out of",1,0

"nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie flicks , but honestly why would we bother ? every single film in the zombi series delivers great fun , nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and zombi 3 is no exception to this , despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting . this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project , who had to elaborate further on his zombi 2 success , but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films . the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity , every ingenious idea from george a . romero's night of the living dead and the crazies is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at . yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over the top gore compensates for everything ! on a secret army base at the phillipines , scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus death one and prepare it for transport . after a failing attempt to steal the virus , the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village . the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area . this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's nightmare city . truly bad . but incredibly entertaining with fast paced action sequences and several very creative zombie madness situations . the undead birds were original , for example , and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well . the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick . recommended to the fans ; don't mind the negative reviews .",1,0

evil warlord puts a town through pain and suffering . not long before they call upon giant stone samurai daimaijin for help . daimaijin soon comes and really gets the warlord with all his viscious might . the revenge climax is really funny as daimajin squashes guys under his feet and crushes guys with his fist and even drives a spike though a man's heart .,1,0

i'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars . but they just don't understand the movie . the story is about growing up in a difficult situation . there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren . and there's good reason why so many critics like this movie . and the reason is because they understand the movie . i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people . i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write 10 lines . i frankly don't have anything else to say .,1,0
"budget limitations , time restrictions , shooting a script and then cutting it , cutting it , cutting it . this crew is a group of good , young filmmakers ; thoughtful in this script yes , allegorical clever in zero dollar effects when time and knowledge is all you have , relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time , devotion , locations ; and getting a first feature in the can , a 1 in 1000 thing . these guys make films . good ones . check out their shorts collection heartland horrors and see the development . and i can vouch , working with them is about the most fun thing you'll do in the business . i'm stymied by harsh , insulting criticism for this film , wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue , pondered one thought or concept , or if all that was desired of this work was the visual gore of bashing and slashing to satisfy some mindless view of what horror should mean to an audience . let the empty acre bring itself to you . don't preconceive what you expect it should be just because it gets put in the horror thriller genre due to its supernatural premise . it's a drama with depth beyond how far you can stick a blade into someone with a reverence for a message that doesn't assault your brain's visual center , but rather , draws upon one's empathetic imagination to experience other's suffering of mind and spirit . mark ridgway , curtis , the empty acre",1,0
"don't you just hate them slashers that never seem to get started ? it sometimes takes them a full hour of lame red herrings before some real action takes place . tourist trap isn't like that ! if it's typically gruesome slashing you want . than it's typically gruesome slashing you'll get ! plenty of it and constantly from start to finish ! this movie contains what is probably the greatest opening sequence in 80's horror cinema when a teenager , on a stroll after engine trouble , is trapped in a deserted house and assaulted by a creepy collection of wax statues . four other lambs to the slaughter arrive at the house and encounter an utterly insane maniac that looks somewhat like a mixture of leatherface from texas chainsaw massacre and one of those mad sculptors from old wax museum movies . tourist trap is exciting horror entertainment , with some genuine suspense , grisly images , ultimate weirdness , morbid humor and terrific make up effects . the plot twists aren't always original and the acting is pretty lousy but , seriously , who cares ? the fast pacing and the groovy killer icon caused this tourist trap to earn a spot amongst my 5 favorite slashers . a bit surprising is the total lack of nudity , though . too bad , because all the girls look ravishing and after only 10 minutes , the obligatory line who needs a bathing suit ? is spoken .",1,0
"one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravo . initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it . to be perfectly honest i wasn't disappointed . the main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well . you would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film ! my only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnik . christ its bad ! the prison guard hank is woeful too . all he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co guard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end . the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions . this movie is well watching alone for the beautiful , talented and very sexy jennifer thomas",1,0
"some films just simply should not be remade . this is one of them . in and of itself it is not a bad film . but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title . liam neeson was excellent as he always is , and most of the cast holds up , with the exception of owen wilson , who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke . but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects . again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film . but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .",1,0

"this is the second baby burlesk short to be released , and probably the most popular one , is a spoof of the 1926 silent film what price glory . i watched this and i do not understand the kiddie porn that is being claimed . it is just a cute little film . i have seen family shows that i grew up watching in the '80's and '90's that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a 'mature manner' . it was more provocative because they weren't dressed in diapers . there's nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes . just a joke i read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this . that is sick . to me , if you watch this and are bothered by it , then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you . it is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film . all of the b . b . films were parodies , nothing more . the parodies spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language . shouldn't those be more appalling ? i can watch those without issue , but they sometimes take children's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies . that is what should get under your skin . not that they babified not a word , i know an adult movie from 1926 , because we know how pornographic those silent films were , huh ? not to mention those 'forbidden hollywood pre code era films' so vile and filthy . they would never make such filth today ? note the sarcasm",1,0

"not one of your harder hitting stories , and that's a real strength of this film . there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all too predictable romantic tension . they not only spare the audience this , but throw in some surprises at the same time . there are a few disney ish moments , particularly near the end , but they are manageable . overall , it was worth the rental and it was good , relaxed fun . btw , if you get the dvd , watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi . we followed her directions and it was brilliant ! next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it , because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out !",1,0
". as i was when i saw this movie i will never watch this movie again , not because it is a bad movie , but because it scared me so much ! as i said , i was 14 when my english teacher decided to show it to us ; the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book . all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over kidd's bed , although , just before that there is something that also frightened us , which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow , and he hears a child's voice say it's for you . that scene still haunts me to this day , nearly 7 years after i saw the film . if you are easily scared , avoid this film !",1,0

"i think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial africa in the 50's and 60's rather than as a story . because there is no real story here . just one vignette on top of another like little points of light that don't mean much until you have enough to paint a picture . the first time i saw chocolat i didn't really get it until having thought about it for a few days . then i realized there were lots of things to get , including the end of colonialism which was but around the corner , just no plot . anyway , it's one of my all time favorite movies . the scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry . if you like exciting movies , don't watch this you'll be bored to tears . but , for some of you . , you can thank me later for recommending it to you .",1,0

"the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show , but as a movie , it doesn't work in the same way . don't get me wrong this is a very funny movie , full of biting , witty dialogue , that caricatures the modern british chav wonderfully well , whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious , if unrealistic story . one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant , or it's embarrassing to watch . when i say embarrassing , i don't mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras , but rather , you'll wish they hadn't included it in the final cut . one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended , to the tune of , this is how we do it . whenever i watch the film , i stop the dvd when it says the end , and leave it at that . overall , ali g indahouse is a good film , worth watching a couple of times . the script is enjoyable to an extent , and there are no issues as far as acting goes . however , refinement is the key word here . ali g is a better television programme . borat is a better film .",1,0

"it is a damn good movie , with some surprising twists , a good cast and a great script . only a couple of stupid bits , like the rasta hit man scene this guy's a professional ? but that has been commented on already . the fact i had only heard one guy at work mention it before , and did not have many opinions or reviews to go on , made it even more entertaining . this gets a higher score than maybe some people think it deserves , but i have to factor in the low budget and the good effort from the cast . it sickens me that some movies get made whose budget equals the gdp of a small country , with a hyped up release , good reviews , an oscar winning director and or actors , and turn out to be so disappointing , with actors sleepwalking through their roles and uninspired directing , with predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so big , sandra bullock could drive a bomb loaded bus through it . examples in my opinion are the terminal , castaway , matrix revolutions extra points are awarded for the wardrobe department choosing great clothes for the cast , especially paulina porizcova , who wears a rubber dress in one scene , and a jacket with c nt on the back in large letters in another ! a sex scene which shows off her tight ass and a good soundtrack are added bonuses ! and please , enough with the tarantino comparisons , this did not remind me of a tarantino flick at all . and tarantino borrows virtually every idea he has ever had from other movies ! even if that is your opinion , are we saying once a certain film or book is written or directed one way , no one can ever use the same ideas again ? get real . this film has it's own style .",1,0
"small spoilers alert ! good movie . very good movie . and i'm surprised to say that myself , because i'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name deran serafian usually means bad news . most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen . this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action . this movie really fascinated me . good accomplishment , seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved . it really is the story that keeps you focused . especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied . sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth . it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle . of course , that's where the reality and the based on a true story stops . the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker . in this movie , the count vlad teppish emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman . and they're all pretty girls , i'll give him that . overall , good acting by unknown faces , enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline . this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore . but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr . heck , it's a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title . these two films have nothing else in common , but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture . check it out . my humble opinion on to die for 8 . 5 10",1,0

"the movie freddy's dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other nightmare on elm street , yes it has comedy essence about it , so has all the other films , but how can anyone possibly say that you wouldn't find freddy krueger scary , if you were to come across this man in your dreams you wouldn't find him even more scary with a comic essence about him because his comedy shows that he doesn't care at all about killing you that he finds it extremely funny , and freddy also plays comic mind games with them , which in its own way is very disturbing , by using his comic ways i think that makes the horror movies nightmare on elm street what they are today , the writers are extremely clever making krueger comic and scary as oppose to jason vorhees , who doesn't say anything and hasn't got the wit to truly frighten his victims , this movie is about as good as freddy's wit gets and i would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour and by the way don't fall asleep ! .",1,0

as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one live tv when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader real name anakin skywalker when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground,1,0
"the 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun . sometimes , there were some definite brains behind it all evil dead ii , night of the creeps and return of the living dead for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends . movies like pieces and blood diner stacked rental shelves in the 80's and 90's , offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment . kevin tenney's 1988 movie night of the demons is a part of this tradition stupid , poorly acted and not an original bone in it's body , but dammit if you don't have a good time . the plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80's a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20's decide to go to a party at hull house thrown by angela mimi kinkade and suzanne scream queen legend linnea quigley . well , angela and co . decide to throw a s ance . this turns out to be as will arnett's arrested development character gob would call it , a huge mistake , because a demonic force soon possesses angela , and starts to get to the others as well . take the evil dead , a nightmare on elm street and your average dumb dead teen flick , throw them in a blender , and night of the demons is what you get . the movie is anything but original , and really , it's not a good movie . the whole thing is insanely derivative , the acting is terrible , the jokes often fall flat , the characters are annoying especially the character of stooge and the plot holes are numerous . that out of the way , it's still a lot of fun . so why ? well for one thing , the make up and gore effects are top notch , with some really memorable moments especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick that really stick out . it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously , yet with the exception of some terrible puns , plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness . plus , there's a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that's almost impossible to resist . yeah , it's nothing special , but it knows that , and it couldn't be more proud of that fact . it's a goofy party horror movie , and it never pretends to be anything more . it might not be a classic , but night of the demons is a good example of horror junk food done right . it might not be too memorable or original , but sometimes you don't want a fancy beer . sometimes you want a budweiser .",1,0
"toy soldiers is an okay action movie but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the scriptwriters and director put into portraying american counter terrorist forces accurately . just check out the end credits there are more than a dozen us military officers and officials listed . the movie accurately portrays the fbi as having control of the hostage situation but turning it over the us army's delta force who are unnamed in the movie as the pentagon was still denying their existence at this time once the president waived the posse commitatus act of us code . the us army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time . and even the use of an ah 64 apache for air support which might seem a bit over the top , is not terribly unrealistic . far more expensive and frankly better movies have portrayed american counter terrorist forces with far less accuracy .",1,0

"spoilers ahead it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be such a disappointment . i thought this was full of silly clich s and that it basically tried to hard . to the american guys out there how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds ? to the married girls how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight but not with your husband ? to the french would you really ask about someone being la fac when you know they don't speak french ? wouldn't you use a more common word like universit ? i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understand europe and i love it , but my german roommate and i found this pretty insulting overall . it looked like a movie funded by the european parliament , and it tried too hard basically . it had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together not a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward , but in fact ridiculous too many clashes that wouldn't really happen . then the end of the movie the last 10 minutes ruined all the rest . why doesn't xavier talk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris ? why does he just walk off ? why does he just run away from his job , is that freedom ? and in the end , is the new europe supposed to rest on a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day ? is this what it's made up of ? besides , the acting was pretty horrible . i can't believe judith godr che's role and acting . why was she made to look like emanuelle b art so much ? at first i thought xavier was ok but with retrospect i think he was pretty bad . and that's all really too bad , because technically opening credits , scenes when he's asking what papers he needs it was really good except for sound editing around the british siblings , and the soundtrack was great too . so the form was good , but the content pretty horrible .",1,0

"i've been a huge fan of the cky videos , jackass , and viva la bam for a long time . they've had a great run and i expected my laughter to end , eventually . but , it hasn't yet . this movie kept my mouth open the entire time . i'm still laughing , randomly . i went to the theater with low expectations , thinking it wasn't going to be better than the first . oh , how incredibly wrong i was . there were many great moments in the movie . if you're squeamish , don't like randomly placed raw humor , or if you disliked the first movie , you probably won't like this . but , with that said , i almost wet my pants from laughing so hard . it had all kinds of different pranks , masochistic humor , toilet humor , puking , laughing , some great falls and massive damage done to all of the cast . ryan dunn even branded bam's rear end with an image that will be stuck there for a long time . i'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is . no pain , no gain ? right ? this movie has already done well , causing theaters all over america to laugh so hard , they'll be wishing it could last longer . i know i did . this movie did not feel short , at all , especially with the credits continuing the footage . but , i still wish it could've gone on forever . now , let's just wait and see when they release jackass number 3 ! overall , an excellent film , if you can get past the male nudity and a few sickening images . keep your kids out of this film . they don't need to see this , at least until they are older . support the crew and buy this when it comes out on dvd ! i know i will .",1,0
"if you are going to watch this film because michael caine or michael gambon are in it then don't bother , it's not their typical role although i found gambon fantastic . instead watch it for dylan moran i am a fan of everything i have seen him in and this is no exception , i didn't even realise he could act but even the characters which he has to pass himself off as i found completely believable , which is impressive considering the audience knows they are fake . the plot is genius and although it is not constant laughs all the way through it has plenty of other charms . a great film for people with a sense of humour .",1,0
"interesting cartoon , included on the dvd of the lost skeleton of cadavra . i especially like the way the color was used in the background art very artistic for columbia , whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget and the results looked like it ! i do wonder , however , how a certain . um , finger gesture . ever got past the censors . granted , the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today . you'd think someone besides the animators would have noticed , though especially since it's seen three times in the scene in question ! and based on the context , i suspect that its inclusion was intentional , something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors would notice !",1,0

"as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9 mbb bo 105 flight scenes in this movie . one of the few disappointments was the ews 39 jammer pod , in this case an inert rb 75 maverick missile painted black with the letters ews 39 in white along the side . real jammer pods definitely do not look like that , at least not the ones i've seen . but apart from that , it's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending the last minute . anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units , including the now legendary ssg , on film should see this one .",1,0
"i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this movie . other than the mother being a complete moron on a few occasions and the youngest daughter being idiotic enough to go out at night , into woods that scared her in the daytime , this movie was pretty good . had the director had the sense to treat us as if we had brains , maybe he'd have given us a movie where the people didn't have to behave idiotically , but still manage to get into danger . it worked for the plumber and the fellow in the trailer , but apparently the teenagers and the mother needed to be idiots , for the director to get closure in ending this film . atmosphere was great , scenery was awesome and the undead kids scared the crap out of me . i live in a wooded area , so taking out the trash will creep me out for quite a while . the movie works for me accept for what i already mentioned . raise the mom's iq a bit and i'd give it a ten .",1,0

"the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia brooke adames bradley marshall jeff hayenga who have tried for the last five years to conceive , virginia has had two miscarriages since then is desperate to have a child . they visit dr . richard meyerling james karen for help after he is recommended by some of their friends , dr . meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child . dr . meyerling operates on virginia it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success virginia is pregnant . at first everything seems perfect the marshall's couldn't be happier , but their picture perfect lives don't last for long as virginia's pregnancy develops problems , she becomes moody acts totally out of character she receives a worrying phone call from beth jane cameron , another woman who has undergone dr . meyerling's procedure , who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher . virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her . produced directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror thriller it's definitely not a sci fi film as the imdb would have you believe that pleasantly surprised me . the script by henry dominic tries to be different it must take some credit for that at least . the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares bad special effects , it's got quite a clever story that works plays on basic human fears . it moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means . the climax was good seemed a fitting way to round things off the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then , maybe flender knew something the rest of us didn't . on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times . also , i have to mention it , what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh ? ! director flender does an ok job , the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it's good enough . the atmosphere is good there's a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her dr . meyerling's sinister plans aren't fully revealed until the last possible moment . disappointingly the blood gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens , the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i'll remember too much about it . technically the film is ok , i'd imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it's well made even if it's a little bland forgettable . the baby creature is actually a decent special effect has fairly realistic facial movement . the acting is good this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends 1994 2004 star lisa kudrow , i have to be honest i don't like friends i don't even know who she was in this so i can't tell you how she did . the unborn is a good horror thriller that deserves to be more widely known seen , it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves . if your a horror fan are looking for something a bit different , something slightly more intelligent thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn . followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii 1994 which i watched straight after this , check my review out if you want .",1,0

"cult classics are nearly impossible to predict . who could guess that vision quest , fight club , and 2001 a space oddysey , movies that were panned by critics and audiences alike upon their release , would become immensely popular ? like many imdbers , i consider myself a movie expert . unlike the majority of those who hated envy evidenced by a dismal 4 . 4 rating , i found envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade . the plot of the movie is ridiculous . the dialogue isn't clever , the scenes have little continuity , and the script seems like it was written by a fourth grader . but that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious . you see , in order to appreciate the accidental genius of envy , you have to enjoy the movie from an ironically detached point of view . why do i love envy ? because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good . this is the recipe for a cult classic , and envy definitely fits the bill .",1,0
"hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr . sebastian caine kevin bacon finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum . they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla it works perfectly , caine his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human . he manages to persuade his team to help him the procedure works well caine becomes invisible , however when they try to bring him back the serum fails he remain invisible . the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works , caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory . but then again he's invisible right , he can do anything he wants . directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man . you know it's just after christmas , i saw this a few hours ago on late night early morning cable tv worst of all i feel sick , not because of the film but because of the chocolates fizzy pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief . the script by andrew w . marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle has a good central premise , it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man 1933 film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit . it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror , sci fi action provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes . i thought the character's were ok , i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it's generally known that verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety , the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that caine says to himself . then of course there's the gore , he shows a rat being torn apart that's just the opening scene after the credits , to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty sadistic tone about it . having said that i love horror gore exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me , it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea . director verhoeven does a great job , or should that be the special effects boys make him look good . the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular more or less flawless , their brilliant it's as simple straight forward as that . there's some good horror action set pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over the top . i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins , organs bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla . there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten , someone is impaled on a spike someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results . with a staggering budget of about 95 , 000 , 000 hollow man is technically faultless , i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they ? the acting was ok , bacon made for a good mad scientist anti hero type guy . hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film , well i know i do . good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier darker streak than the usual hollywood product , definitely worth a watch .",1,0

"spoilers spoilers spoilers just a few small ones saw this on satilite channel , missed the first 30 min of movie , will keep this comment short and informative . the movie is basically about 5 characters , the acting is very bad for afew characters . 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it backfires and the 3 kidnap the 2 . this is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical , mysterious and . you get the point ; but do to their own , personal , lack in thinking they fall terribly short . like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd looks the part but his tongue can't speak it . the writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly unknowingly i believe that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it . i wish i could give an example but i cant recall any exactly as it was said . the ending was bad as well . but the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady , although she , as well as the rest , had a lot of clich s . so why would i give this movie a 7 stars if i thought all the above ? simple , i give the entire seven stars to lisa keller one sexy a momma . she is fine lol . i am an appreciator of beauty , and she is exactly that . but don't get me confused because i'm not a pervert and this movie is not a porno in any way . their is somethin about her i cant explain , but i like it . i remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out , bumps into keller . she tries to get way but she doesn't have a chance . he throws her down , kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down , no panties ; . now , although she has an amazing ass and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think it was her facial expression that got me . she wanted it , and that look had me thinking i was behind that . i would have torn that booty up ! after that expression , i jus couldn't look at her objectively anymore , i was in love . lol . i am glad to have seen this movie but if lisa keller wasn't playing the lead role , i would have changed the channel . well . after i had seen the scene i mentioned above . i am a lisa keller fan know , but is seems that she isn't a consistent actor , seeing this 2003 movie is her latest . but i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it .",1,0

"yep , you read that right , kids . michael bay should've studied this film before making either of his over hyped , overlong , overly pointless transformers movies . robot jox is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the transformers crew spent on megan fox's personal trainer . thankfully , this little robotic gem , initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert band's empire pictures studio , seems to have developed a cult following over the years . i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the cold war era politics stereotypes were already out of date by that time just the bands' luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released , eh ? , it's still a pretty damn cool little b movie . they really don't make'em like this anymore , or if they do , they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportions . for those who are unfamiliar , here's the robo scoop we're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust , large scale wars have been outlawed . disputes between nations are now settled mano a mano or perhaps that should be machine o machine o by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots . whichever 'bot walks away from the fight wins for his side . gary graham who would later go on to play detective sykes in the alien nation tv series , plays achilles , the greatest robot jock in marketplace a . k . a . the good guys history . achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts ten being the maximum number of battles before a jock is retired and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the confederation i . e . the russkies ! , the psychotic alexander who is the most over the top evil russian stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgren's infamous turn as ivan drago in rocky iv . the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles , but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain . a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout , but achilles simply wants to bow out , hang up his helmet and move on with his life . rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more , i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns , behind the scenes skullduggery , and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow jox before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale . i hope i'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction , because it isn't . robot jox is just plain fun . i'll grant that it is a bit higher concept than your average b grade sci fi movie , and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green screen trickery , it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empire full moon pictures factory . the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion model techniques , and the sets and costumes don't look half assed in the slightest . empire pictures and director stuart re animator gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture . unfortunately it didn't quite pan out for them or the studio but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal . bottom line if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2 hours , feel free to rent a transformers movie . by the end you're likely to feel like you've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game . if you want to have a rock'em , sock'em robot good time , pick up robot jox instead .",1,0

"cut is a full tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do . most of the standard slasher cliches are there ; the old creepy house , the woods , the anonymous indestructible serial killer , buckets of gore , and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex that's hardly a spoiler . the set up is simplicity itself film school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece , unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast . this also neatly okay , messily disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel . they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film , played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines . the rest of the cast fit their roles well , especially the lovely jessica napier , who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her . there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments , and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace . it also has an appropriate low budget look , including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate . good soundtrack , too . if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send up of or a homage to the slasher genre . probably a bit of both .",1,0

"i forsee many students now signing up for student exchange to barcelona and being disappointed when they don't have quite such an exciting time . the movie was enjoyable . it's of course always a pleasure to see audrey tatou . however , i have a very strong issue with part of the movie . the lesbian roommate tells xavier that women like to be physically dominated which i take issue with and shows him some sort of butt grabbing move that's guaranteed to get a woman . xavier then tries out the butt grab on a shy married friend who starts out saying no no i'm married , i'm married but then somehow succumbs to the butt grab ? all of a sudden she's moaning yes yes and they're going at it on the benches in parc guell . i found this really really offensive . furthermore it is very stereotyped . how often have we seen scenes where the woman says no but obviously doesn't mean it ? no means no . grabbing butts physical domination isn't going to make it right . it just totally supported the stereotypical rape myths . i wasn't even sure how to read the next scene where he gloats to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time he was just going to demand suck it , slut or something like that . did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to go ? this section really ruined the movie for me .",1,0
"mirage 1990 is a very rare horror chiller from 1990 , released here in the uk on the new world video label . it's a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend , only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck ! this film has some creepy scenes , and some gore here and there , but i have to say that the acting was so lame , even by low budget standards ! but the film was oddly addictive and i liked it , and i never fell asleep or turned it off , which is always a good sign ! i nearly gave this movie 6 10 , but seeing as it built up steam along the way , had some good moments of gore and suspense , had some good nudity , and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too ! i'll give it 7 10 .",1,0
"i'm grading this film on a curve , in other words , it isn't the greatest film that has ever been made but it does exactly what it set out to do . this is an excellent t a film . i have no idea the count of how many t's or a's were seen in this film but i did see one shot that had 16 bare t's at one time , just to give you an idea . there are topless girls all throughout . there is a wet t shirt contest scene . and the climax involves a game of touch football between two all girl teams and every time one scores a touchdown the entire opposing team losing a piece of clothes . i don't know why this gets such a low rating here . perhaps the people who gave it low scores thought they were going to see citizen kane . i love this movie and hope to find more similar ones . if you are looking for a good campy t a film i'd recommend this one .",1,0
"critics and audiences both pretty much panned this movie , but i actually didn't think it was too bad ! even the critics i normally agree with thought it was crap , and i normally despise pg 13 horror films . so this means one of two things either 1 i'm too easily pleased , and my taste in movies has dwindled over the years , or 2 'when a stranger calls' isn't nearly as horrible as it's made out to be . now , to be fair , some of the criticisms of the movie are true there's not much character development , and not much happens in the story . but man alive folks , how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked ? cut them some slack ! as a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out , i can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy mofo ! who knows ? i guess stuff like this just gives me the willies . yes , i admit i had fun watching this , and i don't care how big of a minority that puts me in . ;",1,0

"here's what i knew about atlantis before watching it it's officially disney's first animated sci fi adventure . i'm not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described . the preview looked , for the most part , damn cool . evidently , it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact . it apparently did so badly that disney said , screw it , let's re release 'spy kids' . so , with all that said , how is the movie ? hella cool . i'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway , but atlantis goes all out . it's a throwback to all the cgi eye candy shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin , so much so that it's almost an effects animator's best of show . the characters maybe aren't that memorable except , perhaps , for the ship's medical officer , and the plot's a little dull , but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot . here's a controversy that bothers me . the failure as in , it only took in , like , five hundred million or something ; i know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc . has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation . i don't think that's true . how do you account for the south park movie ? what about final fantasy ? really , the story and the artistry is everything , not the method . i don't know what disney's comeback movie will be like , but i don't think they're out of the picture yet .",1,0

"it's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school . if you liked this movie , then i would suggest you watch valentine . i just found out today that the guy who played marty simon killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job . i wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie . it starts out when carol tricks him into going into the girls restroom to act like they were about to do it . when he was changing in the showers , carols popular friends snuck into the bathroom and got everything ready , camera , electric shock , pole . when marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked . he tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it , grab marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling . they picked him up , dunked his head in the toliet while it was being flushed , and they electricuted him slightly . when the kids are in detention , given by the coach , 2 of the boys give marty a joint that will make him throw up . skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him . while marty is puking in the bathroom skip sneaks into the science lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was . the lab blows up disfiguring him badly . 5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got invitations for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it exploded . one by one the people get killed off . i don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned . she could have gotten back up after marty left . she almost got out the first time .",1,0
"i found this flick enjoyable and involving to watch , and i'm surprised it's rated so lowly . actually i can see why it is ; i imagine it's the fans of eric roberts and alyssa milano that have been giving most of the 1s and 2s , because if you put the tape into the machine expecting to enjoy watching something starring either or both of these two then you could be rather disappointed . eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the movie , and alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half , and in those she says little and wears less although never nude if that's what you're looking for , stick with embrace of the vampire . although they're always a pleasure , it's a pity she , or eric , don't get much screen time yet i still give this an 8 .",1,0
"i'm a petty officer 1st class e 6 and have been in the uscg for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard . there were only a few scenes that were far fetched . the most far fetched was when po fischer kutcher went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room . that would never happen . swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances . second , the command center supposedly in kodiak , it looked more like a nasa command center . we don't have any gear that hi tech . third , the captain of the airstation would not be running the search rescue cases with like 10 people on watch . in reality it would be an e 6 or e 7 as the sar controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist sar controller a radio watchstander . otherwise the movie was dead on , i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search rescue instead of just aviation based rates . some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days .",1,0

"i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago . i enjoyed the film at that time , so i was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since . perhaps it's my memory , but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival . i'm really not sure which version i prefer , but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both . let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie . although it's been promoted as a hammer films tribute , people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed . there's some cleavage , but no nudity a staple of the british production house's later movies . and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film , and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt , it's not like any of the company's pictures in tone or execution . this film is very dark , very confusing , and at times very funny . i don't remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one , but that's not a bad thing especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short . and some of ms pitt's rantings are quite entertaining . it's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose . the uniqueness of this film doesn't lie with the borrowed details , though . it's in the ideas . as an occasional sci fi channel viewer , i've regularly taken the network to task for its one note variations on a theme cgi monster kills , then gets destroyed . sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while . but don't get me wrong . i'm not complaining . if anything , i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising low budget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts . it's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are . but for the rest of us , those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films , the predictability , the lack of respect for the audience , this may just be your ticket .",1,0
"although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out , this is a total lie . in fact , apart from the opening segment , the film isn't even a horror movie . with its sunken treasure , legions of fish people , and mad scientists , it's a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie . obviously , this film is no work of art , but it's kind of fun to watch . just be warned that the beginning is quite gory .",1,0

"the costumes and make up were grand , there were some exceptionally funny lines , and the role was made for jim carrey . carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing . sure this was mostly a movie for kids , but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of dr seuss . i expected more from ron howard . it's worth a see , but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic , by any measure .",1,0
"sometimes good things happen by accident . i'd never heard of silverwing until late 2005 i was flipping channels and happened to see something on toon disney with bats in a sawmill being attacked by owls . i had no idea what it was , but i was motivated to stay tuned it was hard waiting for a commercial so i could find out what it was called ! part of what intrigued me was the looks of the bats first of all , they didn't use the popular convention of giving the bats extra fingers where their thumb claws are supposed to be . rather , they have palms like human hands , but the fingers are longer and have webs of skin between them . also the faces they look like human beings in fact , at one point i wondered if they had once been human but were transformed into bats . ordinarily i don't like this in cartoon animals , but it worked here the story is a human story , even though it's about bats and other animals not unlike the lion king . what i saw on tv were the last two parts of the trilogy . i'd missed the very beginning of the first one , towers of fire the second overall , but for the most part i saw all of each of them . however , i found myself wanting to understand what was going on , since the first part hadn't been on and i wouldn't have caught it anyway . but i saw that it was based on a book by kenneth oppel . how fortunate that i paid attention and wrote it down i was very disappointed when i learned that the series wasn't available ! it wasn't even that recently made that it made sense for it not to be available yet . however , i did find not only the book silverwing , but also the two sequels sunwing and firewing . when i read the first book , i was left wondering is that it ? not only because a lot of what's in the series isn't in that book , but even had i not seen the animated version , the book silverwing otherwise a good story doesn't end so much as it stops . only one loose end is tied up shade and marina meet the silverwing colony at hibernaculum . in fact , silverwing and sunwing should have in my opinion been published in a single volume , because they make for a complete story together , but not separately . actually , the animated version takes some elements from sunwing e . g . , orestes , the lifting of the ban from seeing the sun and some were completely original . it's not perfect , but it's definitely very enjoyable . i enjoy both versions of the silverwing saga . which is why i'm glad it's finally going to be available in june . it was a long time coming , and it's well worth the wait .",1,0
"existenz combines director david cronenberg's traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality twisting david lynch film . and it actually works effectively . i won't bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it'll only cause more confusion . all you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality . the film almost seems to abandon its technology fearing point at the end , but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue . there's also some very gross sexual imagery based around the 'bio ports' in the protagonists backs , as well as some very gross acting from jude law . he manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of . jason jennifer leigh comes off much better , and everyone else can be called a supporting character , including willem dafoe in a functional , if unspectacular , role as a money crazed mechanic . overall , existenz is a very effective sci fi film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive .",1,0

"i had a personal interest in this movie . when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union . at the end of my first day sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc . for one or two weeks . when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego . just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn . once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton , the big marine base . there , on the beach , we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base . it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation , which included a water tank , gun entrenchments , sand bagged trenches and living quarters . all this was at very high pay , sometimes 'golden time' , which was triple our regular hourly wage . our food was also first rate prime rib at lunch , etc . which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home . once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out , which was about eight or ten months later . then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen . then it was no more than three or four minutes maybe less of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens . a bit disappointing , but still fun . in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since . i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis , which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there . bob weverka",1,0

"i saw the grudge yesterday , and wow . i was really scared , a good thing . i love horror movies , and i really liked this one . there were so many 'surprise' scenes what's the english word ? that made you jump in your seat . though , too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh . i think the most scary scene was . on the bus , when the face flashes by on the window , or when yoko's walking without her chin . the make up is also very good . sometimes you could really see it was there , but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene . the boy was very good indeed , so cute without make up and so terribly scary with it on . the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared .",1,0
"what more could i say ? the americans totally hated it because the u . s . cut was so bad , although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it . talking about the u . s . theatrical release along with the newly released blu ray disc version , it's faster and tighter than hk cut , the background musics were all changed from the dark , grim hk musics to hip hop musics ; and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out . though , the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor's voice and tone . but , the problem is hak hap black mask the movie was designed and meant to be dark , grim , super disturbing and totally gruesome . very unfortunately the u . s . release just skimmed the cream they wanted , which in return completely changed the movie's undertone hk release was rated 18 to be even more comical and amateurish . now let's talk about the original hk release . this movie is like a hidden gem , a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era . the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit old school among hk movies . however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture . with all the leather , black costumes and decorations , this movie features a batman like superhero in a black mask against a run of the mill gang of multinational super soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss . yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child , but it works . it's so impressive that the whole movie's gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats . in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg 13 rating , but without jet li and liu qing yun . and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship . and , did i happen to mention francois yip ? her roundhouse kick was totally cool , even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting . did i mention she was also smoking hot ? anyway , there are a lot of things to like about the movie . however , the movie also suffered from a lot of problems . first off , it's a mediocre script made at its best potential , which means this production team deserved a better screen writer . there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences us version was even worse because all the character developments were cut . anyway , you can't ask too much out of a comic inspired action movie . also , this movie is entirely improper for children . i won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old . it's saturated with disturbing contents including blood , gore , sado maso costumes , extreme brutal violence and so on . along with the style of the movie , it can be called a wet dream for heavy metal rock music fans and action fans . the u . s . cut was milder , but if you want to see it , see the hk release for what it is . 7 10 . status inspiring , hidden , undervalued , adult .",1,0
"ah , classic comedy . at the point in the movie where brains get messed together , a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially , reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole movie . for years and years , bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him . we want to see weird movies like bubba ho tep . we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies , and we want to see 'man with the screaming brain' . with the title alone , one knows that it's going to border that completely silly type of movie , like army of darkness , only with more silly and less monsters . the idea of the movie is simple . bruce sees doctor . doctor has new idea . bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor . coincidentally , it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him . hilarity ensues . with the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy , and journeyman stacy keach as dr . ivan ivanovich ivanov , it's funny , that does this movie . complete funny . never a point of scary . if you like the silly bruce campbell , you'll like this . then again , why would you be watching this if you didn't like bruce campbell ?",1,0
"just as the new bsg wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting , caprica may not deliver what fans of the new bsg were expecting for the most part . it is a very interesting , if not somewhat self involved show , or at least the pilot is . if you're looking for the big cgi thrills of the new bsg , you'll be sorely disappointed . if you liked the drama , you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with . the storyline does examine on how the cylons were developed , why adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society . the writers also manage to tackle humans 'playing god s ' and the creation or re creation of 'human' life . it will be interesting to see how this plays out . i found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others , but all in all it was promising . a small part of me wishes or hopes there might be some minor inklings of bsg in there aside from the back story i mentioned , but that would probably convolute the storyline too much . like bsg , i'll have to wait and see if caprica grows on me , but it's way too early to tell . it would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series , but i'm willing to give it a chance . overall , i thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing in the proverbial towel' .",1,0

i've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that paris hilton was in it as well didn't give me the best impression of the film . then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film . it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it really scary for me . i was watching through my fingers the whole way through . so i say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film doesn't convince you to go watch it then it also has chad michael murray in it which can't be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh ?,1,0
"we went to the cinema expecting a biggish budget release and got an art house movie . the movie was projected digitally onto about two thirds of the screen real estate with sloping edges classic of digital projection , and had a limited stereo soundtrack which was wasted on the cinema experience . the content of the film was the same old historical content we have all seen before , but heavily sanitized to prevent the audience being sick . live action scenes what little of them there were , were re used constantly in classic documentary style , which became annoying after a while . i was somewhat amazed that only 4 people turned up to watch it , guess the rest knew something we didn't . i suspect the producers made the film to recognize the ninetieth anniversary of gallipoli . i have to question whether they should have bothered . seven out of ten for trying , and out of respect for the anzac's .",1,0
"i agree with most of mr . rivera's comments , and i just want to ad a couple of caveats . this film , the mascot is criminally neglected in its current form . for that matter , so is vampyr . the mascot isn't a bonus feature it's tacked on as a chapter in vampyr . even though it's made very clear that this is a separate movie , it should have been treated as such by the manufacturers . and while i m at it , vampyr needs some of that same respect and cleaning up as well . i got the feeling the decision to put the mascot on there went something like this . dude a we just transferred vampyr to dvd , but it comes up about 20 minutes short . we need to put something on there that won't cost much money . can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films ! dude b not to worry . i have this little animation thingy that's been sitting in my drawer . just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter . dude a you're awesome , dude b . the animation's of the mascot is great , and there's no need for me to repeat what mr . rivera's done so well . however , this thing needs some major cleaning and restoring , especially the audio . the plot comes through in the dialogue . and in my copy there were so many hisses , pops and places where the sound just dropped right off i would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box . no amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable , it just brought up the tinniness and made the hisses and pops louder . bottom line is starewicz's films need to be put into a respectful collection , cleaned up , spiffed up , liner notes and the whole nine yards . in other words , they need to be criterionized 9 out of 10 for the movie , not the product which would get only a 5 .",1,0

"the other reviewers are way waaaay off as to why the farscape show has been temporarily put to rest . it has nothing to do with the quality of the shows 'slacking' . in fact , the exact opposite is true . they kept getting better and better ! i have seen every episode and when you simply watch them in order you really become in awe how much cooler it gets as they move on and on , and the wormhole aeryn subplots are really very interesting and gave it more vibe , not less . before it was sort of chaotic , slow , and rather aimless . they spent like the first two seasons running from this foe type , but in the second two they were actually trying to do something also i have never seen such a great fun blend of sexy gals and attitudes in sci fi . the blue girl zahn was cool , but not 'sexy' . they literally got to the point where the gals were running around in leather corsets and high heels blasting aliens now tell me , what could be cooler than that ? the real reason farscape went off for a bit is because it was costing too much and that is a good thing for the fans , because the show , watched end to end , is really like a 60 hour long epic movie , with all the cinematics of the blockbuster stuff ok ok they do use similar sets a lot , but the cg is great and the gals are sexxxy . blah blah the real reason is because tv shows are about profit . it is a business , and the sci fi channel or whoever was not getting as big a return on this expensive farscape show as they could with junk shows like 'stargate' . lexx was actually cool until they got rid of the hot german girl and replaced her with this bizarre fat lipped oddity . anyway yes , remember this farscape kept getting better and better , until it was really like a little real movie each week . then the networks decided 'hey people will watch any old piece of drek we shove on the air as long as it is the only sci fi thing on at that hour , so why are we spending all this money on farscape , let's shove cheesy low budget 'stargate' down people's throats and call it a 'hit series' because it's like all we play every darn night lol that's the way it goes . also i gotta tell ya that claudia black is a really cool actress . after she got her facelift got the baggy eyes tightened she was looking really cool one of those dynamic types like judy davis , and sometimes hot looking , sometimes ugly like a roller coaster ride . i'd par claudia black with lucy lawless in style and substance both very fun to watch not just chrichton and yeah you may say the pregnancy thing was cheesy , but how many sci fi shows have a believable and deep romantic subplot that actually goes somewhere and progresses ? it was legitimately cool as a romance story the actors on the show are great . it really is a shame the show is in limbo for now , but i hope it comes back in more episodes soon and movies as well , because i will deffinately buy them ! d",1,0

"just watched this one again . i wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time . this is why these kind of movies are made , to entertain people and zombie bloodbath 2 does that for me and for everyone i have showed it to . the story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farmhouse . when a scarecrow that is actually a demon i think gets disturbed , it comes to life and re animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries . this leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town . pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies . i loved this movie ! from it's different formats black and white film , video and digital cameras to the very fast pace and great music , there was always something going on and it never bores you ! sure , it's cheap , but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film . i have read other reviews and all i can say is that these people have missed the point . if you want 35mm full moon fluff , or if you are into modern stuff like urban legend , then i say pass on this . if you like low budget stuff like gates of hell and evil dead , i say buy this now . the make up and gore is very good , the acting is uneven at times , but over all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive . there is enough going on in this one to fill two more films ! it is actually one of the better b movies i have seen in ages .",1,0

"i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it . what's great about it is the atmosphere , the music , the location , the cinematography and the beautiful cast . the story is non existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter . the pace in languid and the settings are exotic . the film has a lot going for it . unfortunately , it also has a few things going against it . the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever . because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability . according to imdb , al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie . they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen . the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous . there's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i've ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross dresser ! the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend ! and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter , in mid air . and al cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera ! i kid you not . ridiculous . we later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola . while the footage rolls , al and annie start making out . this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much . watching the footage of the cross dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud . is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way ? the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag , certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman , while piloting a helicopter , no less . al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene . i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly . speaking of drag , another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his two wives . a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting . the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex . in fact , orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film , even when he's with annie belle . this is another minor complaint about laure there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era . it just needed more skin to punch it up . except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments , laure is actually very watchable . i love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere , not the crude stuff we see today . p . s . make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt , which stars annie al but also another famous screen couple , laura gemser and gabriele tinti . the music in that movie is also great .",1,0

"if you're actually reading this review , i give you a lot of credit . you care enough to actually look up this movie , which most people have forgotten about and then cared to read beyond the first review ! so for your reading pleasure . i'm assuming you know the plot line already so i won't waste time typing that out . i will mention that sandra bullock did an amazing job with this movie . she really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer , often difficult to do . i can say this because i happen to be a computer programmer . anyway , i thought the basic plot was a very good one . you can easily build sub plots upon its mainframe and turn it into a very enjoyable movie . the premise is also scarily realistic in that this can all really happen if the right precauctions aren't taken . to make a long review short . oops ! too late ! if you enjoy sandra bullock bringing a role to life and want to see a very well made movie for the time , take a look at this little gem . you won't be disappointed .",1,0

"it's easy to forget , once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more , that once upon a time , the x files' wrote episodes like genderbender and fearful symmetry , where the aliens weren't all little grey men or mind control goop , but could actually surprise you . fearful symmetry starts with an invisible elephant actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time , not a mile away from the walk and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted . and it's very much an episode of wonderful moments . the subplot is annoyingly worthy yeah , we get it , zoos are bad except when they're not but the ideas that within it are fascinating , visually powerful , and very memorable , and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested in ? in the end , it wasn't an instant classic , but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted , again , very memorable , and mainly , it's something that you couldn't imagine many other shows doing .",1,0

"i haven't read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on , but who knows , maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health . it isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health , but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie . you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i've read on one hand , but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire , i get the feeling that she writes really good novels . the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history . still , stuart townsend's voice over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt's vampire narrative ever did , and you can tell that queen of the damned's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline . while interview decided to go with lace and elegance , queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously . one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places . the costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack . however , i'll give credit where credit is due . the soundtrack is excellent . korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead . the film opens with a very cool goth rock zoom splice montage , but after the first ten minutes or so , the directing degenerates quickly . it's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice . what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects . unfortunately , queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress . where are the yellow contacts ? where's the pale blue make up ? scene after scene , i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem's lot and fright night when low budget was done right . there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage . props to aaliyah , and may her soul forever rest in peace . she might have become a renowned actress , had her life not been taken from us so prematurely , for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing . did i mention that the soundtrack was good ? let's see , what else can i say ? it wasn't too long . the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it . there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot . but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second rate vampire movies out there . the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything . jy jimboduck dot com",1,0
"i can't believe how many people hate hal sparks ! he was my favorite host of the show , hands down . i hate celebrity gossip and generally dislike talk shows , but when hal sparks hosted talk soup , it was must see tv for me . i rarely missed an episode during his run , and was saddened when the guest hosts started pouring in although most of the guests still did a fine job . anyway , for all the people who dislike hal sparks , i imagine they must have never seen the weekend specials . they were hour long episodes of talk soup that comprised the best clips from the entire week , and were padded out by sketch comedy bits . the original bits that hal sparks did were hilarious . in one he got possessed by a bad comedy demon , and in an exorcist like scene his head spun as he told dated jokes about airline food . one episode was dedicated to making fun of multiplicity , as a bunch of cloned hal sparks kept multiplying through out the episode , over running the studio . ok , maybe these don't sound as funny when i describe them , but all i know is that besides talk soup , the only other two shows i watched consistently during those years was the simpsons and late night with conan o'brian . so if you like the comedy stylings of those shows , then you'd probably like talk soup during the sparks years . that said , henson and tyler were both great hosts as well . all three hosts brought something different to the table but they were all fine comedians in my opinion . of course , throughout the tyler and guest star years , my interest in this show began to wane , but every now and then i catch the soup , the show's spiritual successor , and sure enough , the new host can bring some pretty unexpected laughs from time to time . ok , i've wasted enough time talking about a tv show that isn't on the air anymore and on a channel that i generally despise . go watch something else !",1,0

"i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever . ' what ? haven't any of you seen cradle 2 the grave ? my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid , and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on . duh ! what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie ? did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story , then just loaded it up with action ? of course not ! black mask is awesome , wall to wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time . it's also deliciously gruesome , and we get plenty of severed limbs , decapitations , and creative ways of watching the bad guys and quite a few innocent people , too ! get slaughtered . most of li's other martial arts films are nursery school when compared to black mask ; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence , bloodshed , or action sequences whatsoever ! and that made me a happy camper . again if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot , you are going for the wrong reasons . black mask is probably my favorite of his movies though , beware of the horrendous dubbing .",1,0

this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan which was aired at least 15 years ago . the series was known as gubbarre meaning balloons . each episode was a new short story . the story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and convincing abhay doel does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a normal and third class guys as he calls himself in the movie . in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the abhays role but shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off . i would suggest watching the series if it is available . it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction . the acting of the tv actors was much better than these stars . the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour or 45 minutes story to 2 hours . so it has to get draggy . even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up . this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original tv serial . the script and the ending of the serial was much better spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him . he is aware and tell her that he doesn't want to be repayed and never helped with that intention . the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film . the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement . the deliver just wasn't right . but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy . no credit should be given to the director scriptwriter . the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of premchand munshi . i am not sure if this is premchand munshi's story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi's and other great hindi writers stories .,1,0
"i actually really like what i've seen of this cartoon so far . sure , the animation isn't the best , but frankly , i'd rather see this type of more cartoony style done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply which was starting to happen more and more often it's only a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it . there's nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little black dot eyes in fact , i think it's really cute . as a kid i never thought scooby doo's design was particularly adorable , but i think i might like it better know . anyway , shaggy has always been my favorite character , and believe it or not , but i think he has the most potential for some depth . sure , the show doesn't center around the original mystery solving theme , but that was just a tired old formula anyway . don't get me wrong i'm sure there are writers out there who would be able to bring a lot more interest to mystery inc . 's traditional pursuits which has been lacking as late , but in the mean time this show is a fun deviation from the standard . shaggy and scooby are still funny , but no longer only comic relief . they're still cowardly , but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be shock ! intelligence . they're the same old over eating slackers as ever , but now actually seem to be getting on with their lives with the help of uncle albert's inheritance . i used to find most original scooby doo jokes to be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best , but this show actually exercises a capacity for real humor . also , i never really like casey kasem as shaggy anyway , so the new actor doesn't annoy me as much as he does other people . i still think billy west was the best , though overall , while not a great cartoon in the scope of all of cartoon history , still an achievement among other scooby incarnations .",1,0

"i really liked batman dead end , i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film . this trailer didn't quite give me the same impression . the story line , or potential story line , was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show . first , michael o'hearn is not that good a superman . i actually thought he , in his brief appearance , made a decent clark kent . sorry , i just don't think of superman as being that buff . the suit kent wore masked his size . batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman . supes is toned no doubt but not bulk . anyway , i didn't care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy . now this may not be just o'hearn's fault , collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction . second , the special effects for flying were cheezy . superman flies through the sky . if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground , with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him . i don't think there were any full body shots of superman flying . evidently the harness and rigging supporting o'hearn must have been located on his lower torso . all in all it was a good trailer . i'd probably pay to see a film , if ever made , and would be sure to catch it on television . the story line , an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries , superman jealous of lois's attraction to wayne , lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman superman is a good one . i'm sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company , even o'hearn could deliver a decent film . certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately .",1,0

"coming from the same director who'd done candyman and immortal beloved , i'm not surprised it's a good film . ironically , papierhaus is a movie i'd never heard of until now , yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades . not talking about iranian or swedish cinema here . the acting is not brilliant , but merely solid unlike what some people here claim they must have dreamt this wondrous acting , much like anna . the story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly . these unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose , leaving it up to the individual's interpretation , and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this . pepperhaus is a somewhat unusual mix of kids' film and horror , with effective use of sounds and music . i like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie clich ultra shy but secretly brilliant social outcast girl , but a regular , normal kid ; very refreshing . i am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit like childhoods into their books and onto the screens , as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly , lonely childhood , as if that's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential . the scene with anna and the boy snogging for quite a stretch was a bit much evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement considering that she was supposed to be only 11 , but predictably it turned out that burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed . i have no idea why they didn't upgrade the character's age or get a younger actress . it was quite obvious that burke isn't that young . why directors always cast kids older than what they play , hence dilute the realism , i'll never know .",1,0

"i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films i've ever seen . this film is packed with stupid dialog , ridiculous scenes , and a self involving plot , starring legendary horror director lucio fulci himself . the threadbare story line is about an aging director fulci , who is also named lucio fulci in the film . who is starting to go nuts and hallucinate because of all the vicious things he's put down in film over the past many years . he goes to a shrink who hypnotizes fulci , and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer , but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing . the rest of the film is made up of shots from the film that fulci is directing during all this action , scenes of the shrink killing people all the while grinning like a f ! cking moron , and some of fulci's hallucination sequences . oh , and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well . a cat in the brain is completely over top and ridiculous in every sense . the gore is classic fulci nasty and strong with some really decent scenes . the chainsaw sectioning of a female corpse is pretty cool , as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy . lots of stabbings , gougings and other cool kill scenes make this one a pretty non stop bloodbath . the ridiculous dialog lick it ! lick it ! , as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes the nazi orgy , the opera singing slap fest and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind . make this one fun as hell . not nearly as dark as some of fulci's other films cat is more of a self indulgent horror comedy that if it wasn't meant to be funny , is actually kind of sad . i say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one . i watched cat with a few friends and we laughed the entire time . this is the feel good movie of the summer . recommended 8 10",1,0

"attention , spoiler ! many people told me that planet of the apes was tim burton's worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film . so i decided not to see it . another friend of mine who hadn't seen the movie yet , advised me to watch it in spite of this because a tim burton movie is still a tim burton movie' . i decided to do it , and i found that he was right . it's clear that a remake of such a famous film as planet of the apes' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking . still , tim burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as beetlejuice' or batman' . if you are already fond of burton movies , it's hard not to like one of his films , even if it has some flaws nerve racking monkey squeals , over dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been , without difficulties , replaced by anbody else . what the film gives us in the first place , is an answer to the question what's the result when tim burton is instructed to create a remake ? first of all , burton wouldn't be burton , if he wouldn't refuse to call it a remake from the start ; it's a re imagining' . on the other hand , burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring charlton heston as human , and he knows that a remake doesn't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared . so all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film , e . g . by referencing to quotes . concerning the story line , burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first , and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with and here is the spoiler leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever . now , this is the burtonesque answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing , shocking ending of the first planet of the apes' . an ending , even more unexpected , more astonishing and completely confusing , because and here i'm disagreeing with various planet of the apes' homepages and platforms it does not make any sense . there cannot be a meaning to it , or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective . tim burton is playing his cruel games , he does it with a grin and he does it well . burton fans will sure like it , others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism . well , and i don't think producers will ever ask burton to direct a remake again",1,0
"i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy . the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects . what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget , locally produced valley forge pa christian shorts . let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious . that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits . for what it was meant to be , this film is excellent . i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts , blair witch project was one of them , that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot . bwp was pure excrement . the blob , on the other hand , was well thought out , well scripted , and thoroughly entertaining . the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy . the scene in the doctor's office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece . bottom line is , i love this movie . i challenge anyone out there to take 120 , 000 . 00 , inflated for today's dollar value , and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob . it just can't be done . period ! thank you for taking time to read this review .",1,0
"wow , this was another good spin off of the original american pie , not as good as band camp , but definitely a lot better the naked mile . dwight and erik stifler lead the comedy in this one , but i actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile . the script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed more smoothly , however most of the comedy came from sex , but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway right ? the midget rock also had a really good cameo , considering the intense effort given by him in the naked mile , his scene with stifler was awesome and had me laughing my ass off when i saw it . the movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile , if you liked any previous american pie films , you should like beta house , unless you view all of the american pie spin offs a waste of money .",1,0
"seriously , i don t really get why people here are bashing it . i mean , the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd . the good news is , the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness . especially in the second half of the film , when the little killer snowballs attack , i laughed my ass off . for example , the put one of the little creeps into a blender a la gremlins 1 and mix it . after that , it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice that was fun ! . bottom line incredible movie , rent it .",1,0
"ok , i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i don't know why . i haven't seen it since , but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film again i don't know why . but the fact that i remember it speaks volumes . comedy is hard much harder than any drama . doing it right makes it seem easy , but doing it wrong . is there anything worse than a bad comedy ? steve martin , pay attention , you are falling in this category again for some reason . elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly . done at a quick pace , with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn't the philedelphia story , it entertains from start to finish . brain donors is another that fits right in this category sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes . one point of contention the ending . it seems the writers director had no idea how to finish a comedy . the ending tries to be a love story , somewhat undermining the quirky fast paced dialogue up to that point . then there is the tassle scene . whereas this has to be seen male opinion , it is so over the top and out of place it's like a shock . one more rewrite for the ending was needed . this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail . but if you don't try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you , you'll laugh , i guarantee it .",1,0
"style over substance . but what a style it is . the cell is the internal version of most serial killer movies . unfortunately , the story hardly supports the visuals . psychotherapist catherine deane j lo goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions . a new patient whose fallen into a coma , is brought to her attention by the fbi . he's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins . deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim . director tarsem singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production . each dream sequence is like a nightmare ish painting in motion , from the landscapes to the costumes . but the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters . stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about . without him , you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only , which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary . lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway , though she's as gorgeous as ever . and vince vaughn ? i don't even know why he was chosen . this is not his forte and he overacts to boot . he tried too hard to become his character and it showed . stick to comedy , vince ! even so , this movie is so visually frightening , i still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward .",1,0
"like many here i grew up with scooby doo . unlike many here who did , i love this show ! i think that it has been very well done and thought through . everything about it marks it as a spin off which isn't meant to be taken seriously . the formula is simple it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy . by using the well known shaggy and scooby doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode . there have always been scooby doo spin offs which have annoyed fans . the classic being the scooby shaggy scrappy shorts from the 80's . these spin offs had their place they allowed new content to be sold , created new fans , and kept scooby doo merchandise on the shelves . i would agree that shaggy scooby doo get a clue ! doesn't fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what i had always wanted the scooby shaggy scrappy shorts to be an action packed show which focuses on the best funniest scooby doo characters ! good features of the show the animation , the voices , the attention to detail , the bad guys , the best friend relationship between shaggy and scooby doo , the constant humour ! bad features none , although the revamped mystery machine is pretty close at times . well done warner bros . animation ! one of the cleverest cartoons in a long time !",1,0
"this is best showing of what i think jesus really was like . most movies show jesus as being effeminate , lobotomized , or tortured . this jesus laughed , played , and was serious when it was necessary . this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to , not the usually hollywood version . the movie took some liberties , attempting to fill in the blanks . but the fillers didn't seem impossible , or even improbable . one thing i might argue , was that it never really explained what the romans had against jesus movie portrayed that the romans were the main driver of jesus' death , not that the jewish authorities were against the idea . it seemed that the movie was researched well . one example was the offhand comment to a teenage boy who was called mark . it is believed that mark or john mark was the boy referred to at the garden of gethsemane whose cloak was pulled off and ran away naked mark 14 51 . i get the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate even in spirit was much as possible .",1,0
"progeny is about a husband and wife who experience time loss while making love . completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they try to go on with their lives . the hubby begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist . he comes to believe that aliens are responsible for this lapse in time and that the unborn baby he once thought was his and his wife's actually belongs to the aliens . if ya ask me , this is a great scifi horror story . taking a highly questionable real life scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definite thumbs up from this guy . i love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas . so if you also share an interest in things extraterrestrial , you should be pretty happy with progeny . at least story wise anyways . unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average . with average acting by all actors . yep , even by the consistently awesome mr . dourif , who still does deliver the best performance . though the black head doctor , delivers his lines really well . there are a few points in the flick where some of the delivery is cringe or laugh worthy , which is fine in my book . i like them cheesy and this had a little bit of some nice stinky cheese , and i mean that in a good way . anyways , with a less than stellar script you can't really blame all the actors . i especially didn't care for the mother hysteria the film went for . she wanted a baby so badly that she'd neglect and dismiss everything her loving husband who's a doctor ! said to her . it almost reached a point where you actually didn't care what happened to her . the progeny is another flick by brian yuzna from the icky sticky film , society . again he delivers some slimy effects , and again he delivers a pretty unique tale of horror . if you're into scifi horror or are a fan of dourif and or yuzna films , there's no real reason not to check out this flick if you get the chance . a generous 7 outta 10 .",1,0
"women will like this movie better than men . of course , women like all romantic comedies more than men on average . i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit , however i considered this a 5 . 5 for the first 50 of the movie and about a 6 . 5 for the next 40 and about a 9 for the last 10 . so , begrudgingly , i will rate it a 7 . i tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse at least that's my objective . i have over 1200 movies , so why keep the dogs . my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me , though i'm not sure why . i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is . the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school undercover to write a story about the high school experience nowadays . she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around . her journey toward cooldom , as well as her falling in love with a teacher , is the story . what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked . i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog . so much so that i truly don't think i want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning . argh ! naturally , she transformed into a rather attractive cute woman by the end and she became very popular . the ending is about a 9 . 9 on the very sweet scale , so you sappers out there will like that . otherwise , it isn't very memorable and easily missable .",1,0

"forget neo and bourne and all those half baked made up modern heroes . they only look 12 year oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes . since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones , hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick . however , their action set pieces are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question . this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years . for better rocky , rambo or worse die hard 4 where john mcclane , brace yourselves . had no beard ! i say it is high time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end . this largo winch movie is far from perfect , and perhaps too predictable at times , but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action hero . and the only one time where he was weakened is when m lanie thierry shaved his beard ! i rest my case . i didn't know it when i entered the theater room , but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade . for the first time in france since belmondo , can a movie be both well crafted and rooted in b genre without blushing over its performance . in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience . in other words it was le pacte des loups or dobermann i like dobermann , mind you . i believe largo winch has what it takes to be both popular and quality film making . i exited the theater room very pleased , and hungry for more .",1,0

"okay , sure , this movie is a bit on the hokey side . it's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility dolph lundgren as the punisher , anyone ? , but this tries very hard . i've never read the actual comic book , but that doesn't really matter , i suppose . i judge a film mainly on its merits , not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea . unless its a film based on a true story , that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy . so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating ? because it tries . it tries very hard . in my book , that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film . many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus . it seems everybody has their take on vampire lore , be it the cross , the silver , the garlic , the aversion to sunlight , whatever . some of those ideas are included here . the storyline is familiar . a group of vampires conspire to take over the world , with one person mainly standing in their way . blade wesley snipes lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses , who have slowly but surely moved into the world , and share it with humankind . for the most part , the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them . the vampires have even taken familiars , people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turned . now that i think of it , there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the roddy piper film , they live . a hidden enemy , hidden group of people plotting against them , the fight to save human kind . all that is present in blade as well . the acting isn't the best here . snipes is , at best , only slightly better than some of his other roles ; n'bushe wright , a relative newcomer , isn't too bad ; kris kristofferson is forgettable as blade's sidekick he's to blade what chip is to the punisher . stephen dorff does the best job of the whole cast here , as the head vampire you just love to hate . i don't know , but i just loved the special effects in this film . from the blood soaked vampire style rave , all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film , the special effects aren't half bad . there's certainly enough blood and gore to go around , but after all , this is a vampire movie , right ? the various shapes and sorts of weaponry blade uses are fairly unique , and not generally used in contemporary action films . snipes has more flair with a decked out sword than he does with , say , a machine gun . plus , there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away . unless , of course , you are indiana jones . overall , this isn't the best action film ever made , but it's not half bad , either . as a bonus , the musical score soundtrack are pretty cool , too . tell me , in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like source direct or photek ? ! my rating 8 10",1,0
"the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point . it's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time , or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace . if only it was that easy . but the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better , as the situation gets worse and worse every single day . well , if you're not part of the solution , you're part of the problem . the central theme is that revenge begets more revenge , which begets even more , in an ever expanding bloodbath . both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side , which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation . where does it end ? and apparently he missed the significance of the bubble referred to in the name , which was that people living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them , which is partly why they seemed so naive . he also seemed to think that ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem , which tells me he wasn't paying attention when ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered . i found it very brave of the director , the screenplay writer , and both star crossed lovers , to update the romeo juliet story to a modern troubled land , and to make both lovers male . let's be honest here very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female young love wins all hearts but when people's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that , incredibly , these same people would rather have them hate each other , then the conclusion is inevitable .",1,0
"okay , my title is kinda lame , and almost sells this flick short . i remember watching siskel ebert in '94 talking about this movie , and then playing a clip or two . not being a rap conscious guy although i could identify snoop dogg , vanilla ice , and mc hammer music , i wasn't much interested when they started talking about the film . but then , s e showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name using some shady logic and a bunch of made up facts , and then another scene where the band , and their rival band , both visit a school to promote getting involved and , of course , nwh comes up with some info about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee . so i filed it away that i should see this movie . a couple of years later , this thing shows up on hbo and i recorded it , only to laugh my butt off for hours . yes , it has a spinal tap kind of rhythm to it . even the documentarist takes essentially the same tone in setting up the clips , and the band follows a similar path what i now call the behind the music phenomenon smalltime band has good chemistry , gets famous , too much money too fast , squabbling , drugs , some type of death , band breaks up , then reconciles , finishing with a hope for more albums in the future , and fade to black . the one thing that is true is that in spinal tap , you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past . but tap drags at some points , and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes . oh , this is his rant about the backstage food , this is spot where he wants the amp to go to eleven , this is the spot where the guy makes the pint sized stonehenge , etc . contrasting to foabh , which seems to have more unexpected humor . you can see some of it coming , but there isn't a big setup for every joke . sometimes , the jokes just kinda flow . cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked . also , the direct references to vanilla ice , hammer , and a bunch of other caricature type rappers really worked well . this strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs , and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes . and the songs . is my peanuts better than big bottom from spinal tap ? i don't know but they're both damn funny . tone def's awful video during his awakening phase is so bizarre , yet so funny . i could go on awhile , but save your time and don't waste it on cb4 . i watched the first half hour , and got bored . you don't get bored on foabh . there are slightly less funny moments , but you can never tell when something good is about to happen . perhaps my favorite scene is when ice cold and tastey taste name ripoffs if i've ever heard any discover they've been sharing the same girl . at one point , you've got those two pointing guns at each other , and the next thing you know , the manager , the photographer , the girl , and i think even tone def are in the room pointing guns at each other , switching targets back and forth . and , of course , someone does get shot . i did find it odd that nwh's managers suffered similar fates to spinal tap's drummers although none spontaneously combusted , i don't think . there were enough similarities that i cannot ignore the likelihood that cundieff saw spinal tap prior to writing this film , although this is clearly much more the spinal tap of hip hop . while some similarities exist , the humor is different , and the movie seems more like a real documentary maybe because we don't recognize a single actor in this thing , even the guy who played lamar from revenge of the nerds . all in all , this movie has , in my opinion , street cred . kinda like nwh .",1,0

i suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay . i thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called the fear halloween night . i expected this movie to be somewhat of a halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy . but it opened with a good scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people including his mother and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit . pretty good for a sequel and i never even seen the first .,1,0
"so the wwe has done it . they have poured over into film ; their first one being see no evil , starring their very own kane . i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film . it just seemed to clich and looked like nothing new . to my surprise it actually wasn't half bad . a viewer stated above that it is good b horror movie fun , and honestly thats the best way to describe it . now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold up . well let's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the 'jacob goodnight' character . he sold the role really well , and really did look menacing . but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle . the acting was decent , and the story was nothing new of course , but we all know that . the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done . considering this was directed by a porn movie director , i was quite surprised . i'd recommend this movie if you're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun . think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film . and save room for the ending too , cuz it's a good one . and stick around after the credits too .",1,0
"i tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch . i was immediately sucked in by the characters . robin tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film . her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100 believable . really , this sort of thing is not easy to do . she pulls it off fantastically . we know early on this film is going to end tragically , but you cannot take your eyes off of it . the characters do stupid things , but unlike most hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it , these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters . this is just a great example of film making imho . great writing , great acting , great directing . a film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment .",1,0
"let me be the first non australian to comment on this i got the movie for hugo weaving and i watched it to the end . it's one of those drama of life films , as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive . i liked the light and the girls . the rest was without too much fault , but without too much merit either . i yearned for something like the interview , or at least some matrix villain element here and there , but nothing out of the ordinary . the story does teach one about facing one's own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you , but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close , so not much of an effort to change things is required . the smart american beauty sound alike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack , but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film . in the end , i guess it did his job of presenting a part of australian life , but to me it didn't seem specifically australian it could have been placed anywhere and it didn't seem attractive as a story . i guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie .",1,0
"soderbergh is a fabulous director , but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels . clearly , he knew this from the get go . the term star vehicle has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star . what this film does is net a whole herd of hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before . the last scene says it all all the stars sitting around with nothing happening and nothing being said . we just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where george clooney , catherine zeta jones , matt damon , brad pitt , and don cheadle are just hanging out , being themselves . so the story's not important at all at least , that's not where the films' greatest pleasures come from . if you want a clever heist movie , better stick with 11 . but if star gazing turns you on , this will make your day .",1,0
"let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice , i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie . those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears . i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors . the acting was better than average , but the plot held no surprises . they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation . now as to the historical errors , if you call them that , the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april , then capt . pike , jim kirk , etc . according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology that's the reason a prime directive was created but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series . i hope the plots will get deeper , and then special effects can take a backseat .",1,0
"legend of dragoon is one of those little known games that people either love or hate . some people claim it's far too similar to other games , namely the final fantasy series which is understandable , since it was originally intended to be sony's equivalent of final fantasy . honestly i can't comment on the similarities beyond that , as i'm not very familiar with the ff games . i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system . not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form , but every time you attack , you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time . not only that , sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence , which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage . even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of button mashing . if you don't want to attack , you can always guard , which not only cuts any damage taken in half , but raises your hit points without the use of healing potions . the fmvs are quite well done , about the same quality as final fantasy 8's . however , the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard . they're nice , but they could have been and honestly , should have been better . the translation as well leaves something to be desired . not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions , but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldn't have been allowed to pass . another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party characters one dies , and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves . while the death of the one character is often said to have no point , it makes you realize early on that the characters , while heroes , are still just as mortal as the next person . the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats , so the transition game play wise is fairly smooth . perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love interest , shana . she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing , pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration . while you can use her in your party , she is insanely weak i don't even know what her dragoon powers are like , as i disliked her so much i never used her . the character rose , by contrast , is probably my favorite female character in any game ever . she's no wimp , and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful . meru is quite strong as well , while sometimes being an annoying talkative brat . the character designers were , as most are , inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever , and didn't give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits . seriously , no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters . but i will give them props , as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries . i can't comment much on the plot , as honestly i didn't pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next . i'm not sure if this says something about the plot itself , or my gaming style . all in all , it's a very enjoyable game . it has its flaws , but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters .",1,0
"soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be . i found the film to have some of the sacarstic , cynical humour like that in paul verhoven's starship troopers . the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere . one particular trivia bit stands out for me todd has the names of several space war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate . for the oblivious ones out there , tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy batty's elegiac last lines in blade runner . to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least . maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic ? i'll give this one 3 out of 5 .",1,0

"what kind i say about this movie . well for starters , i thought that this film was okay , not the greatest not worst . i said this cause i thought that the script was great and original , really different and refreshing . now i wouldn't say that it's the greatest film that i've seeing cause of the acting . the actors that played each role , seems that they played them without emotions , as if they took the life out of them . when the wife laughed or cried , this didn't look real to me for some reason , that's just an example , but sincerely all the characters didn't act real at all . i wish i could say more positive things about this film so you guys can see it at least once but how can i do that since i know that i'm not going to see this movie again . i rented this film from the library of my school , without hearing anything about the film itself or the director . i took a chance because the story that was describe on the back sounded really interesting and it really was .",1,0
"i believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of 8000 but that didn't really show . there wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting , the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of aberdeen . the actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious , deserted and uncharted planet , none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive . there weren't any great explanations of what was going on , which can be really contrived , so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination rather like the big empty which was a film i also enjoyed . i found that i quite warmed to most of the characters , there were some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments , the men were so ordinary that you felt you could empathise with them and the film's climax and ending were quite poignant . i think mr stirton and his crew should be quite proud of themselves i've seen worse films with a budget of millions .",1,0

"i've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life eg what it takes to get into music school , britney bashing , etc , etc . so let's focus on the movie and the message . i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years , and for a family movie . for the average adult male . 2 out of 10 . i like pop rock music , i'm 45 . i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews . i didn't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any 'self promotion' . i watch movies to be entertained . i don't care about casting , lighting , producers , directors , etc . what is the movie and does it entertain me . i watched this movie for the message . the world's greatest epidemic is low self esteem which is a whole other story so watched with the message in mind , as that is an area of interest . the movie is light , bright and breezy , great for kids . i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don't give up message , so yeh , it was a bit predictable . great message though . should be more of them . this movie is a great family movie , but for a bloke watching by himself , get hannibal .",1,0

"the problem with tv today is that people have been spoiled by lite tv viewing . this type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or easy listening jazz . the typical viewers idea of continuity is remembering who got voted off the island last week and wondering who will be the next to go . show them a program like surface , firefly , dr . who , or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and . well , they'll just flip back to survivor . 95 of the sheep watching tv don't want to rack their brains . they want excuses to not think . they want to make sure the boob tube lives up to its name . and they don't want shows that try and go any other route . because of this , surface and many other high quality shows that should have lasted far longer have gotten the axe . tv viewers don't want stories , or morals , or philosophy , or anything over a third grade vocabulary level . they want people eating earthworms , or over dramatized real life series no such thing ! you cannot observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe or hormonal shows involving groups of people having trysts and then bragging about it to their friends . today's television is nothing but a wasteland , and the few diamonds you can pick out of the dust are just tossed out because no one even knows what a diamond is anymore . surface was one of those diamonds .",1,0

"death bed the bed that eats . judging from the title , you can guess what this movie is about . and yet there is a lot more background story to this film then one might suspect . okay , so the main plot is about a bed eating people and food , but there are also a few subplots . i won't spoil them for you , but they're a nice touch . sadly , the acting in this movie is very mediocre . the fact that most dialog is not even spoken by the actors doesn't really help to improve the quality of the movie as a whole . because there is a lot of voice over work . the thoughts of characters are also revealed to the watchers . sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn't . the effects are fine . sure , it could be a lot better if you compare it with today's movies . but you really shouldn't ; just judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously . you have to admit that a killer bed is quite creative . if you are easily spooked , don't watch this movie . you might never want to sleep again . death bed the bed that eats is a strange horror gem with a low budget , but i'd still recommend it to fans of horror movies . in conclusion , i give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for it's creative story and unexpected twists here and there .",1,0
"it was considered to be the swiss answer to the lord of the rings , but it is much more than that . it isn't an answer to anything , it's in itself something new , something funny and sometimes it's downright stupid and silly but was monty python any different than silly ? the beginning immediately makes the statement that this film is low budget and not meant to be taken entirely seriously . cardboard clouds on strings knock into the airplane in which the main character is seated . but , to compensate the missing special effects , the landscape does the trick . it is absolutely beautiful and stunning who needs new zealand , switzerland has it all . what i liked about the film was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy that went into it . it isn't brilliant ; yet it's got some good humorous parts . edward piccin as friedo is absolutely convincing , it would be enough to go and see the film because of him ! there are some good jokes , some of them are very lame , some of them won't be understood by people outside of switzerland . i liked the idea of having urucows instead of uruk hai ; i loved the scene where friedo decides to take pupsi , a telehobbie , with him on the journey . also very funny is the scene when rackaroll , the sword fighting knight , decides to show off with his sword and subsequently smashes it into a wall , breaking it . and there is this one scene where the nazgul ish characters do a wonderfully comic scene that includes a toilet brush . i didn't approve of the idea of the ring being used by schleimli , the gollum character , in order to seduce the ladies . that was a bit far fetched . the idea of lord sauraus wanting to cover the lands with fondue wasn't that brilliant either . original , certainly , but not brilliant . but most of all did i dislike the idea of a gay dragon , that really wasn't necessary . all in all i recommend to see the film simply because it is so crazy and totally trashy . don't expect a lotr parody like spaceballs was for star wars . but if you go to the flicks thinking that this is going to be an amusing evening out , with absolutely no ambitions , then you'll enjoy . i am not sure if it works in other languages , because it does live from the swiss dialects as well as from the jokes and actors . all in all hat off to the courage of the swiss crew who did that !",1,0
"robert culp they call his character doctor . i think he's a vet or something and family move to an affluent , low tax , zero law enforcement suburb . lantern jawed culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and go cruising through his front yard at 60mph . he presses charges , which arouses the kids' ire , and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign . marilyn manson , er , marlyn mason rather , plays his fretful , boiled celery wife , who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses , and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services . but the system is getting culp nowhere , and he's not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music . and we all know what movie people do when the system fails . but this is based on a true story , which makes it even better . it should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient '70s funk o matic teenage theme music that warns us when they're up to no good , this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even handedly really ! . it doesn't make a big generational thing out of it . kudos for that . anyway , if you like dogs or at least believe in protecting their civil rights , like me , and you like justice , and you like fire , and you like justice for dogs by way of fire , and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are too damn soft , then this flick's ethos is up your alley . no , it's not really good , at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word . there's nothing subtle or understated or clever about it , it's just sort of a feature length psa for vigilantism . it does , however , capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other , beloved works . remember in frank miller's the dark knight returns when batman leads the mutants on horseback to reclaim gotham city ? remember that scene in a christmas story where the kid pounds the bully's face in ? remember how cool that was ? or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors ? yeah , mon . unfortunately , this was a 1973 made for tv movie that i just happened to catch at 4am on my local wb affiliate , and it's probably not destined for dvd release . but after being inspired by this film , do you think i'm gonna just sit here and take it ! ? !",1,0

"i see there are great reviews of this film already , i've got a few points to comment on , reasons i thought there was something special about this film . first and foremost , the film is realistic . it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like being a teenager , but that's really the kind of superdrama that goes on amongst teens all the time . second , the good guy , the guy who treats women with respect , doesn't get the girls . that's the way it is , in real life just the same ! he's too nice for his own good . people are just selfish . third , it was nice to see a fat guy who had some self confidence . i mean , that role already takes confidence from the actor , i'm not just talking about the character . overall i thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides amongst wacky , partyin' teen sex comedies at the rental shelf . don't get me wrong , it's not all sad , it's a good laugh as well .",1,0
"this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of . the japanese people ? who star in this must have been really desperate for a job , or we're just friends . here's the scoop three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman , they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her , they burn her , kick her , spin here around in a chair over 200 times ! , they use sound torture by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours ! it don't sound that bad at all , but it can make you go nuts . they throw guts probably from an animal at her while shes knocked out , and she freaks when she wakes up . and who can forget the grande finale the greatest eyeball torture i have ever seen ! if you have not heard of these films , and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film , you will think it is ! just ask charlie sheen this is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick ! like i said pure underground . check it out if you are a fan of underground horror , or foreign gore . if your not i highly recommend you read up on the series before watching ! from the gore , shock , and creativity aspect it gets a 10 , but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1 . an underground classic . my final rating is a 8 10",1,0
"ghoulies iv may not be the best out of the series but it isn't too bad , if you don't take it fully serious then you may enjoy it . it's nice to see peter liapis return as johnathan graves who has gave up using magic and has became a detective but still thinks about what happened in ghoulies . the plot is about a woman named alexandra that is johnathan's ex girlfriend that breaks into a museum and takes a red gem , using the gem she awakens her boyfriend named faust that is johnathan's dark side but he needs the gem so he can enter the real world and john is sent to hell . something goes wrong and alex loses the gem so she needs to find a new one , as she leaves the gateway is still open and two little ghoulies named lite and drak appear . they're not the true ghoulies since they look like guys in a troll costume wearing a mask but that doesn't matter since they are humorous in parts . lite and dark need to find johnathan since he can return them home so they go around causing mayhem as they try to find johnathan . another difference is that the two ghoulies are the good guys unlike the ones in the previous films . i found ghoulies iv to be good but this film may not go for everyone , check it out if you like low budget films like troll 2 .",1,0
"for some inexplicable reason , jerry's movies often seemed to come in for diatribes from certain quarters although they were rarely box office disappointments . it's one of life's great mysteries to me because his films have always had a 'feel good' factor about them for me . but this film is not only not bad it's an exceedingly good and clever comedy . to those who may be tickled by 'modern' crude or cruel humour , don't see this film there's nothing in it like that and you'll be wasting your time . i've only seen this film once on the television . i've waited ever since to see it again and that's been quite a few years . you'd think the idea of an arrogant millionaire businessman heading off to win the war against the nazis with his own small private army of subservient employees would be boring wouldn't you ? well only jerry lewis would dare try such a plot for an out and out comedy and it works , i have to say , brilliantly . i think that , as with 'the nutty professor' and most of his other films , this movie is testimony to his comic genius , both in concept and execution . i think buddy love might have said , you know , true comedy can not only make a six year old hysterical , it'll do that for his dad too . maybe a few nutty nazis generals with monocles and a limp would dislike this movie , honestly . if you only see one more comedy in your life , see this one . be careful though , you might die laughing . and i'm not joking !",1,0
"wow ! all i can say is that if elizabeth montgomery is the enemy she speaks russian , then i'm surrendering right now . in her short skirt , high top boots , and pronounced bust line , she's a real babe , even if her zombie like eye shadow sort of comes and goes . this 30 minutes is no doubt the sexiest of the series . note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with bronson until he ungallantly slugs her on the chin , ruining all the fun . okay , probably i should leave off my hormonal response . this is a very well produced half hour by that underrated force behind the series's success , buck houghton . naturally , the producers want to lead off the third season with an above average entry . it's post nuclear holocaust america we know because she's part of the invading force and only american bronson and soviet montgomery are left , along with about twenty tons of realistic wreckage . they wander among the destruction in alternating moods , while we wonder how long it will take for biology to trump politics , which of course it eventually does , lucky bronson . and that's about it . no real talk , except for what bronson has to say which is pretty overblown . nonetheless , the screenplay is still entertaining , and rather daring for its time , even suggesting that not all russian women looked like truck drivers a popular cold war stereotype of the time . in passing it's rather curious that the very slavic looking bronson buchinsky would be cast as the american and the glossy looking montgomery as the slav . appearance wise , it should be the reverse . my guess is that the producers did not want to cast the american in the physically weaker role of the female , regardless of appearances . however that may be , there is little of the usual tz fright or atmosphere , still the episode remains a very , very watchable 30 minutes .",1,0

"after having watched guinea pig , two questions come in mind besides 'am i really a psychopath to watch that ? ' 'is it a snuff ? ' the answer is no ; although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie i've ever seen . and then 'where the hell have they found that girl ? ' . because she gets tortured for '45 min , without any reasons given in fact , there is nothing else in this movie ! fingernails teared off , beaten with hands , feet , tools , infested by maggots , . and many more until the final scene i'm still not sure how they did that . because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene' , it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money . so what were her their motivations ? i saw it in japonese without subtitles , but it's not a problem no real dialogues , the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes . i haven't seen yet all the serial , but the first guinea pig is not known for being the best one . still i've rated 8 , because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff , the issue is quite good ask charlie sheen , the actor . but i think they could have gone further , which they did in the following ones . another movie i'm hiding from my parents . 8 10",1,0
"historical drama is one of the areas where the british just can't be beat . so while i'm not a huge fan of the genre , i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's british and with decent actors . i have never read anything by sarah waters , which is of course something i should do . hence i didn't really know what to expect from this . i had heard that there would be a lesbian love story , but not much more . while watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated . without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well crafted . although there were almost a twist too many somewhere , it took me a minute to get everything straight . production values are good , the actors are very solid and the pace is decent , although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half hour . that might just be me though , i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished . all in all though , this is a fairly enjoyable three hours . i recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas .",1,0

some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most . i thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isn't it ? i would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven . david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last house . other than that worth a look .,1,0

"trick or treat , quickie review this zany romp of a film revolves around the 80's culture of heavy metal and horror movies two things which i love dearly . so , as you can imagine , this movie appealed to me pretty easily . plus , for no apparent reason , ozzy osbourne plays a preacher . this film is about an unpopular high school youth who , like all us losers , ended up drenched in a world of evil heavy metal . his favorite metaldude dies and , of course , is miraculously resurrected by playing his latest unreleased album backwards . this allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sh t helping out . okay , it's pretty cheesy at times , but you know what ? it's got a surprising number of good qualities . decent acting including gene simmons as a radio dj , pretty good special effects , very brief nudity , decent atmosphere . all in all , it's actually a decent horror film . but what really sucks is the music . ironic , huh ? well , this uber evil metal guy is one of the most obnoxious , high pitched , wailing , motley crue rejects on the planet and the metal is little more than putrid 80's pop hair metal . he hits all the clich 's here , from prancing around like a gay fairy , to looking mean , to screaming rock and roll ! in a pitch high enough to make king diamond retch . aside from that atrocious musical representation , it's actually pretty good . 7 10 www . residenthazard . com",1,0

"let's start from this point this is not a movie intended for the common audience . utterly bizarre , somehow incomprehensible , totally unpredictable , it just keep you stoned watching at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next . if that by itself doesn't make you agree it is an excellent movie , then go back to your family movies and forget about motorama . it has material to be considered a cult movie , it can be placed in the same category with movies that win awards in cannes or other intellectual film festivals , but , sadly , hollywood already let if fall in oblivion , simply because it is not commercial . the performance of young jordan christopher michael may not be oscar material , but he gives the right touch to the story . even the genre is difficult to describe ; it is not a comedy in the proper sense , you don't know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which gus gets involved . it is more like an impossible adventure that some kids may wish to have , but don't let them watch it either . it is not a movie for kids . so , if you like disney movies or are looking for a home alone style , this one is definitively not for you . but if you enjoy reading edgar alan poe or the works of tim burton , then you will like motorama . so , jump in your red mustang , get a tattoo spelling tora and cruise strangeland with gus . i'd like that .",1,0

"world's finest is an unique project . it's a trailer for a superman batman crossover movie that doesn't exists and will also never exists , at least not in this form , with these characters , actors and plot line anyway . so the movie is one big tease , even more than standards everyday real movie trailers . the trailer will hype you all up for nothing . in that regard , i really didn't liked this short project . when watching this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad and perhaps you'll even feel cheated afterward , when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist at all . sort of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place . surely to show off sandy collora's skills but couldn't he had also done this with a real movie short , like his earlier movie batman dead end . but when you have to judge this short purely for what it is , so from a movie technical point of view , it's a really great one . it's great looking and way more professional than you'll perhaps at first would expect , although the people who've already seen batman dead end will already know better than to expect a short with cardboard sets , cheap homemade costumes and third rate actors . the short is not constantly impressive looking and obviously the budget wasn't sky high but for most part it's very impressive and professional looking , with nice costumes , sets , special effects , cinematography and lighting . the short has a good quick and typical trailer build up , with perhaps a bit too many posing shots too completely find it credible but hey , it works well for the trailer style . it has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones , mainly the superman flying sequences . it was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car , with a camera aimed at him from an angle below . i even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch . but really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this . michael o'hearn seemed like a pretty good superman clark kent , although he obviously isn't the greatest talented actor around . clark bartram reprises his batman role well again and kurt carley seemed like an awesome lex luthor . the rest of the cast also served its purpose well enough . it's especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this movie , in the movies batman begins and superman returns . it's interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one . it's actually amazing and fun to hear how much kurt carley does sound like kevin spacey , the actor who played lex luthor in superman returns . it's a good looking and well made and constructed trailer that however will makes you hungry for more , even though you know that there won't be more . whatever happened to the waner bros . plans to create an actual full length superman batman movie by the way ? i thought that developments were underway for it a couple of years ago but nothing has been heard of it ever since . instead two new separate batman and superman movies were made ; batman begins and superman returns . 7 10",1,0
"i can not say this movie was a hilarious , but i must have had a grin on my face the entire time . i like this darker kind of comedy ; very bad things , 8 heads in a duffel bag or coldblooded the way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch . to me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be , but the way that ending came about was . another thing that sticks out , is the way they have managed to involve the audience . the way terry looks at us is hilarious , you can almost pretend you're his accomplice .",1,0
"this is not a serious film , and does not pretend to be , but it is not as bad as some of its reviews , it's title , and the first ten minutes lead you to expect . the plot is very silly , but this adds to the light hearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film . the characters are played sympathetically , and while they do engage in typical teenage angst , they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre . unusually set in london , sympathetic to geeks , this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on ; if you want some tongue in cheek silliness , and don't mind suspending your disbelief .",1,0

"when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long , i thought we were in trouble . condensing the gigantic w . somerset maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen . but you know , the movie's not half bad , and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers . i've heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet noodle of an actor , and he was , but i can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet noodle , for that's certainly what carey is . howard plays him well , which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly , then finally take him out and buy him a spine . ah , and then there's bette , as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him . i didn't know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book , and the movie stays true to that detail . but as played by davis , she does become the most fascinating character in the story , and if she's nasty and unlikable , she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time . davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting , much as brando's would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out stella ! in that little known tennesee williams play , and it's not hard to see why . davis is intense to the point of scary . she makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience , and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous . her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an std is shocking . of course , it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect ; if it had been made a year later , you can bet things would have been a bit different . yes , much of the novel , and many of its most interesting parts , are left on the cutting room floor , and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else . i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of maugham's novel , but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now , so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did . grade b",1,0

"american made final entry in the blood island series of filipino horror films concerns abdul amir reed hadley , ruler of a fictional country . he dies of cancer , yet it's figured out how to bring him back put his brain into a donor body . the mad doctor in charge kent taylor puts it in a highly unlikely body the facially scarred giant manservant named gor john bloom . a doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and put an end to the mad doctors' plans . film making partners samuel m . sherman producer and al adamson director corral several actors they've worked with before , including taylor , adamsons' sexy wife regina carrol , angelo rossitto , zandor vorkov , and vicki volante . they tried to go for the feel of the previous blood island entries but one can tell this was made stateside . while not necessarily a good film , it's got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole . a malevolent dwarf rossitto , gory operations , a rather unconvincing makeup job on bloom , the political intrigue subplot , caverns full of cobwebs , etc . the narrative is actually pretty coherent , with plot twists thrown in here and there . i think it could have been trimmed a bit ; some scenes drag . but it's got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect . for this kind of thing , the acting isn't too bad . both taylor and rossitto are fun ; the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role . volante is appealing enough , and williams is o . k . in the heroic role . in any event , it's nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films . absolutely nothing special , but as a trashy b horror i use the word loosely , none of this is exactly scary film , it certainly amuses . 7 10",1,0
"as a huge fan of horror , i had given up on the vampire sub genre due to the fact that in most vampire flicks the vampire has become feminine and non threatening , benign and basically weak . this was the attitude i brought to a viewing of soul's midnight and i am happy to say that the vampires in this film at least have the hunger to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies ! armand assante , one of my favorite actors of all time , was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity . another thing that interested me is that the central location is the borgo hotel . that is cool because and i went back to my high school copy to look this up in dracula , the borgo pass is where jonathan harker must pass to get to dracula's castle . finally , my hats off to whoever made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a darn cgi ! that's the one thing great about many low budget movies , they cannot afford the garbage computer effects that plague many hollywood monstrosities . bottom line . this is better than underworld for sure , especially if you are a vampire purest . cheers , ja",1,0
"like the first film in this series slaughter , 1972 , i think it would be a mistake to just label this a blaxsploitation film . sure , slaughter is a tough , gun toting , black man but it's more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guys and a very good action picture at that . for the second and final time , jim brown plays the title character . the film begins with one of the goofiest scenes i can remember in a film . as slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party , along comes a biplane and begins spraying the group with machine gun fire ! no , slaughter isn't so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his . 357 ! but slaughter is ticked and no one is sure why this hit was happened however , slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it ! well , it turns out that the hit was attempted in retribution for the last movie . in it , slaughter takes on the mafia and kicks lots of butt down in mexico . now , in a horribly bungled and clumsy attempt , the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people but miss slaughter . and , because the job was bungled so badly , the mob boss ed macmahon ! orders the pilot and gunman killed by his brutal assassin don stroud in a very typical sort of role for him . stroud is great scary and nasty to the core , but ed macmahon as the boss ? ! wow , that's an interesting twist ! slaughter is now stumped . he figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them , they were dead . so , to help him along in his own private vendetta , brock peters who plays a cop tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the hit and got slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work . so , slaughter and his pimp friend break into the mobster's mansion and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officials . and , naturally , there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process . stroud isn't about to let slaughter get away with this and kidnaps slaughter's girlfriend . now it's a standoff slaughter has the list but if he doesn't give it back , the lady is dead . being a tough but gallant man , you might just be able to guess much of what happens next . the action is very good in the film and jim brown is menacing and tough . the only negative i noticed was that while having macmahon play this nasty boss , at the end , he simply folded and way too quickly . when slaughter catches up to him , macmahon becomes a wimp and all the previous nastiness disappears and this is too much of a clich and inconsistent . still , despite this minor quibble , it's an engaging film that is not for the kids due to all the violence and boobs .",1,0

"remember that friend in college who always insisted you rent the weirdest movie possible ? this is the movie he would have made if he'd had the chance . i wish i could tell you exactly what sea of dust was about . it pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the black forest . he goes there to help , but ends up being caught between two young women , both of whom he seems to have a thing for . but that's just scratching the surface . this is the kind of movie where things just randomly happen . and not nice thing . people are constantly being whipped and stabbed . there's a pair of creepy little girls who appear to have walked out of the shining . tom savini is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesn't want to be imaginary anymore . he's got a plan to take over the world by sharing jesus suffering . on some level , this is a movie about sex . it's one without nudity , which was a disappointment , but there's no mistaking the intent . on another whole level , it's a stoner's paradise . unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected . by the time the doctor travels through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn , you'll just chalk it up to the crazy nature of the flick . on the down side , the film is pretty wordy . some of the points are hammered home over and over . if you're watching it with a bunch of stoned friends , this might prove an asset .",1,0

"there's a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldn't direct a horror film of quality if he had to . and , sleepwalkers . screenplay written by stephen king is often used as an example of this . i like sleepwalkers , though i fully am aware that garris just says f ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie . forget character or plot development , who needs them anyway . it's about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkers . feline human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents , moving from town to town , living a nomadic existence , truly powerful set their sights on a teenager who doesn't surrender without a fight . before all is said and done , many will be slaughtered as a mother shan't tolerate the possible death of her beloved son . garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed , as a teacher glenn shadix , suspecting handsome , all american charmer charles brady brian krause to be someone entirely different from who he claims , gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into . charles lures pretty virgins into his arms , drawing their energy , in turn feeding his hungry mama , mary alice krige . the fresh new target is tanya robertson m dchen amick , and she seems to be easy pickens , but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle . thanks to a deputy's cat , clovis , mary's vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way . mary , come hell or high water , will retrieve tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying son . like many teenagers , i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies . such as amy dolenz , i was smitten with m dchen amick . she's simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles , unaware of his ulterior motives . i just knew that m dchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen , but this would never be the case . too bad because i would've welcomed her in the genre with open arms . krige is yummy as the menacing , damn sexy , but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanya's parents in one fail swoop , in less than ten or so minutes . she stabs one in the back with a corn cob ! she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman , before cracking his arm . a bone protruding , knocking him unconscious with his own elbow ! she tosses tanya's mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father's face ! a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles cop kebab ! , falling on the pencil for extra impact . poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary , driven to the brady home , and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster ! the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans . we see mary and charles' abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility . writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers , joe dante and john landis as photograph experts . the film is shot in a tongue in cheek , let it all hang out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home . it's about the ultra violence , simple as that , with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris' direction and king's screenplay . the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in your face . without a lick of complexity , this is closer in vein to king's own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works .",1,0

well what do you think ? it looks as if samhain's production was jinxed right from the start . almost immediately wallmart refused to develop jenna jameson's nude make up shots , and chasey lain began acting characteristically like a drugged out primadonna . finally to add insult to injury , the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re editing and removing all the gore . reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an r rating . veil of course disagreed , seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display . eventually after months of arguments , the director parted company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults . despite countless disruptions , veil's slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium . the copy i was sent was the pre release screener , which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack . but still it boasted a few credible jump scares , some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that i've seen for some time . one guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine , jenna jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and chasey lain ends up 'spilling her guts' after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend richard grieco . even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome , samhain never feels mean spirited , which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clich s . in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall , because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes craven's scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them . certainly the inclusion of the mouth watering jenna jameson was a great move by the producers . her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top as expected and so does chasey lain and taylor hayes . but samhain is no soft porn movie , and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce . it's worth noting that the aforementioned xxx stars almost out perform the supposed 'actors' of the feature , which isn't much of a complement . ginger lynn was at least notable if you ignore the shameful 'oirish accent , and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan chou . taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics , which could have been caused by the numerous problems on set . veil's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much needed injections of suspense . exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds . it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of samhain . rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending , and i'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution . if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched , then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years . this one is certainly worth checking out",1,0
"i find it hard to believe this could happen at all . we do not know if justin and richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past . the movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble . so the first crime they commit is murder ? just to play and jostle with the cops ? how do they pick up any girl and just say you are it ? also richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle . hmmm . this whole concept is really hard to believe . that said let's move on . i found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then . as for cassie who was a victim of carl hudson has a horrible time trying to survive . the memory of having been stabbed 17 times by carl leaves her in an emotional mess . sandra does a superb acting job . she sure made me believe she was one angry cop . as for solving the crime , i thought it was great . this movie kept me planted in my chair . loved the acting of all but sam . he had no get up and go . the one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should i say the rape scene .",1,0

"probably the best horror movie in 5 years . there's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared when all they make you do is walk out of the theater and movies that just shouldn't have been made . but this one is worth it . the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because paris hilton is in it but her death scene makes up for it , believe me . . so here they are . the spoilers of all the death scenes in the movie . 1 . my favorite death scene ever paris hilton's ! after finding her boyfriend blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck , paige starts to run . well , speed walk is more respectable . she finds this like garage with all these cars in it . then one of the killers cuts her ankle from below this whole time shes holding a huge metal spike so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car . the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead . i've never been so excited or laughed so hard in my life . 2 . paige's boyfriend blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him while hes on the ground and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat . then he dies . 3 . elisha cuthbert carly one of the hottest chicks ever doesn't die phew but she does get her lips super glued together , punched in the face , and gets part of her index finger chopped off yeah , i felt like heaving 4 . carly's twin brother nick also survives , but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg . 5 . nicks best friend dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs , and then is decapitated . his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink . then he gets covered in wax . 6 . wade carly's boyfriend gets his achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors , and then is attacked by the same scissors . he doesn't die , but hes covered in wax , and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed , revealing his nasty bloody flesh . yummy . . so there it is . definitely worth your money .",1,0
"it's been a while since i've watched this movie , and the series , but now i'm refreshing my memory ! this was a very funny movie based on the classic series ! johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together . bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee . when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm , bo and luke sneak around hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal . they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip mine hazzard county , unless the dukes can stop him , with the help of their beautiful cousin , daisy . my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn't right for the part of boss hogg , and sheriff rosco p . coltrane was way too serious . other than that , i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard !",1,0
"when i first saw the premiere episode of farscape , i had no idea what to expect . i was immensely impressed and satisfied with premiere . subsequent re watches , however , have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially . premiere is not a great farscape episode , but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters . the episode begins with john crichton ben browder , an astronaut and scientist , preparing to launch into space in the farscape module , a small space ship perfected by crichton and his friend dk . crichton has a revealing conversation with his father , jack crichton , and then begins his test flight in space . of course , everything goes wrong and crichton is shot through a wormhole and winds up in a distant part of the galaxy . after exiting the wormhole , crichton's module is pulled on board a living space ship . from here , the characters and story line for the farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner . the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode . of course , there is crichton , played well by ben browder . he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with . he's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything . in premiere , crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeepers . he knows nothing at all about either side , but in helping aeryn a captured peacekeeper pilot it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers . he probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for crais , a peacekeeper captain , declaring crichton to be the murderer of his brother . this puts crichton in an interesting situation he's stuck with bizarre , violent escaped prisoners in a far off galaxy about which he knows nothing at all . crichton's total lack of knowledge of the farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during farscape's first season . the supporting cast is just as compelling . there's zhaan , a blue delvian and former prisoner . she's peaceful and reasonable , as opposed to fellow prisoner ka d'argo , a powerful and hard headed warrior . virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup , allowing her character of zhaan to appear cool and convincing . d'argo's mega makeup , in contrast , is below par . he looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose , and there is something peculiar about his eyes . they look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup . farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in season 1 , but the overall costume would , for me at least , remain as a problem until season 2 . the puppet digital characters of rygel and pilot are , to put it simply , excellent . rygel is a tiny hynerian dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft . in premiere he is given some good dialogue but not much else . pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship , moya , and moya's passengers . even in the first episode , pilot gives off the appearance of being a real , living alien ; he never once in the show seems to be a giant , expensive machine . the peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well . the peacekeepers are made up of a race called sebaceans , who look just like humans . the chief antagonist is introduced in premiere as captian crais , who believes that crichton killed his brother . in reality , crais's brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with crichton's ship . aeryn sun , a pilot who crichton helps escape , tries to explain that the death was an accident , but crais just claims that she is irreversiby contaminated and refused to change his mind . crais obsession for revenge , warranted or not it should be clear to crais that crichton isn't responsible , is mysterious in premiere , but would be explained later in the season . aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character . by being forced to leave the peacekeepers , she changes her whole way of life , and is in that regard in a similar though less severe situation as crichton . the actual episode , as mentioned earlier , feels somewhat rushed and clunky . so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything . also , d'argo for now looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing . still , premiere is solid entertainment . the special effects such as in the starburst sequences are impressive . most of the costumes and the sets on board moya are original . despite its flaws , premiere is a must see for farscape fans . 3 4",1,0

"an old saying goes if you think you have problems , visit a hospital . that has been updated in recent years to if you think you have problems , watch a tv talk show . especially jerry springer's ! this movie is one of those that is so bad , it's good ! that's why i gave it a seven it's all right , but not great . it's a great way to waste 95 minutes , just as the daily talk show is advertised as an hour of your life you'll never get back ! all the familiar themes are here . unfaithful husbands boyfriends , the wildest audience on television , women flashing jerry , etc . the shocker was watching molly hagan , who normally plays sweet characters seinfeld and herman's head playing a trailer trash mom and jaime pressly my name is earl as her equally trashy daughter , performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact . the men including the staff producer were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got . i don't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show . here in phoenix , it's shown back to back for two hours every morning and , after that , everything else seems to pale . again , i give this movie a seven . it's good but not great . jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses .",1,0

"i'm guessing that we all , no matter if we are fans of cars , luv the sound of a dodge challenger as it growls along the road , the noise a 57 chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and , most of all , the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes . i'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination , but any of the above really does rev my engine ! there's no denying the importance of transport on cinema . it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time space . but the car remains the most popular and most luved , it's even got its own genre the carsploitation genre . a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars . in effect , it's just porn ! car porn ! and i'm not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel 4 in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars . whatever floats your . car , i guess . moving on . whilst running on empty isn't quite as pornographic as vanishing point richard c . sarafian , 1971 for instance , with its close ups of the car in motion , all it's bumps and curves ! , this doesn't mean that the car isn't the main focus of this film . in fact , the cars themselves become characters more on that later . they're objectified and fetishised as much as the women , in fact , maybe even more . and holy holy , are these cars something ! every car in this film besides the ones in the background are simply beautiful works of art , there's no question about it . as i was saying , these incredible cars are , in a way , given characters themselves . you actually start sympathising with the car ! spoiler most notably during the scene in which the car is being wrecked and burnt spoiler over . this has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre ; the evil 1978 plymouth fury from christine john carpenter , 1983 , satan's custom lincoln mark iii in the car elliot silverstein , 1977 , the nifty little mini coopers from the italian job peter collinson , 1969 to the friendly volkswagen beetle in the love bug robert stevenson , 1968 and of course each car from death race 2000 paul bartel , 1975 and even wacky races 1968 1970 all of which had their own character . ironically however , this emphasis on the car often over takes ! the human characters ! and this is certainly the case with running on empty , in which only one human character the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight has any sort of dimension , the rest are very much stock characters . these are all your stereotypical australian 1980s teenagers ; big hair , annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in neighbours , especially the kylie minouge look a like . but who gives a damn ? it's all about the cars racing and crashing ! that's it ! if you don't like that you really are watching the wrong genre . the car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film , and the best thing it's got going for it . they are fast ; very fast ! and we're not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car 'speeding' at around 40mph , and then speed it up . oooh no ! not with this film you don't . these cars are zooming along at top speeds in real time no fancy editing tricks here . so , we've got speed . check . what about crashes ? check , check , check ! whilst there isn't cars crashing everywhere a la the incredibly blues brothers john landis , 1980 , when cars do crash in this film , they certainly crash ! it would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and kaboom they're up in flames . it kind of reminded me of thriller a cruel picture bo arne vibenius , 1974 in that sense . between these simply awesome scenes especially the very start and the very end there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and , in my opinion , fail to add very much to the film . note more exploding cars needed ! however there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes spoiler especially the attempted rape scene . so , all in all , this is a man's film ! a boy's film ! full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too . i'd recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen cyclists ! it's a great film which you can just switch your brain off , sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume ! i'll give it 3 . 5 luvs out of 5 luvs bruuuuum ! p . s amazon are selling this for just over 2 it's a real bargain although the dvd lacks any special features whatsoever .",1,0

"when you read about this film you wanna cringe . i have seen it countless times and yet i cringe myself ! so what is the attraction here ? i think that for me , it's the offbeatness of the romance . i find it super refreshing to have an oddball coupling between this nyc jimmy breslin like columnist and a down on her luck health wise ballerina . you feel embarrassed for paul sorvino at his unsubtle approach to wooing this woman . like the guy in the bar who can't take a hint . he's a bit overweight at least as a would be suitor for a ballerina . hope that doesn't sound unkind and possibly a tad too old for her . nice change of pace from greek god wooing super model . the bill conti score has stuck in my head all these years later , which is a pretty good sign . however some of the acting is just dreadful . a subplot involving a young puerto rican boy befriended by sorvino's character is just hilariously bad . but the opening scene where ditchburn is warming up to carole king draws you right into this story . good luck finding it . you'd think that lifetime would be re airing this or even we , but i haven't seen it on in quite a few years .",1,0
"what the heck do people expect in horror films these days anyway . does is have to be something grisly like 'saw' or it's just crap . ? now , i don't claim to be an all knowing expert , but i'm about 47 , i've seen and own literally thousands of films and i honestly think this director really gave this film a good , sincere effort . believe me , i was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started , assuming it was gonna be awful and i was pleasantly surprised . it's no mamet script , that's for sure ; but come on ! with all the horrible garbage out there , especially in horror , i thought this one was way closer to the top of the pile than most . the director used a lot of neat , clever camera angles ; the soundtrack was excellent and moody , perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film . the editing and timing were very good . and it didn't resort to the tired , worn clich of excessive 'slasher' violence ; for example minor spoiler during an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous but tasty . , uh , i mean tasteful nude shower scene i fully expect her to get sliced and diced ; but , amazingly we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that's it end minor spoiler also , the tension was built very well , leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what . spoiler especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and pinnochio alone in the office ; we see the doll actually talking to her , but in the video recording we do not . also , the mom sees pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty ; so , are both the mom and daughter mentally ill . ? also there is the original 'killer' and what the mom had surmised about a possible evil influence . but even with all that , we are still not quite sure who was doing the killing end spoiler so , all in all , i believe that it was a good , strong , sincere effort to create some good ol' early full moon type style and with a lot of restraint on the violence . and with no typical sleaze thrown in for no reason just the lovely , innocent , beautiful shower scene , which i will remember to the end of my days . compared to the absolute mindless drivel out there , a definite , strong 8 10 !",1,0
"previously , i wrote that i loved titanic , cried at its ending many times over , and i'm a guy in his 60's . i also wondered about why this great movie , which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics , was given only a 7 . 0 rating by imdb . com users . well , i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings . while 29 . 0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating , 10 . 7 gave it a 1 rating . these 10 . 7 of these irrational imdb users , in effect , pulled the overall rating down to 7 . 0 . in my previous comments , i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings , with a high 10 rating , dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio . believe me , i've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men , mostly , who defame him left and right . they absolutely hate the man , and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic . to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much , and gave it a 5 or a 6 , etc . everyone has , and is entitled to , his her own taste . but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7 . 0 overall for titanic , pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings , is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture . let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more , but these 5 will prove my point . heaven's gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing , and imdb voters' ratings were 23 . 2 10 ratings and 9 . 2 1 ratings overall rating of 6 . 1 . big top pee wee 1988 got 4 . 3 10 ratings and 9 . 9 1 ratings overall rating of 4 . 5 . cat people 1982 got 6 . 1 10 ratings and 2 . 6 1 ratings overall rating of 5 . 8 . blind date 1987 got 3 . 0 10 ratings and 2 . 8 1 ratings overall rating of 5 . 3 . jumpin' jack flash 1986 got 4 . 4 10 ratings and 3 . 7 1 ratings overall rating of 5 . 2 . what do all of these films have in common with titanic ? all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower ! than titanic , and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award . again , titanic got 10 . 7 1 ratings ! compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned . can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor ?",1,0

"as shallow as it may sound , i actually delayed my viewing of the barbarians several times just because the vhs cover as well as the picture image displayed here on the website looks so incredibly gay ! by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isn't so much gay . just trashy , cheesy , campy and enormously fun ! it's almost unbelievable that ruggero deodato , director of cannibal holocaust of all people , was the man responsible for this comical cash in on the contemporary popular sword sandal fantasy flicks , particularly schwarzenegger's conan movies . the film opens with a terrific 'once upon a time' type of off screen narrator , introducing us to the ragneks . their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers . in other words , the ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks ! their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy kadar kidnaps the ragneks' beautiful queen canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby . meanwhile , and as some sort of amusing waste of time , the two orphan twin brothers gore and kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and they're unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death . instead of that , however , they escape and develop a plan to free their queen . actually , the plot isn't half as bad as i initially feared , but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers' on screen chemistry , the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy monsters , like a dragon with adorably cute eyes , some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp . the soundtrack and make up effects are great and our almighty director deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace . the barbarian brother's acting capacities are much better than i anticipated , apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds . the supportive cast is splendid as well . eva la rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl cara , virginia bryant is indeed bewitching like richard lynch states on several occasions and the lovely sheeba alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut shaped hair style i kid you not ! . last but not least , the barbarians stars everybody's favorite eyes in the hills creep michael berryman as the appropriately named dirtmaster . i know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the village people , but the barbarians really is a must see italian exploitation highlight .",1,0
many people are making fun out of steven seagals acting abilities . and i really see why if i remember fire down below . well . ok his other films are acceptable regarding to his acting ! . after reading reviews about the patriot i didn't expect anything from this film . i barely came through fire down below and i read a lot that the patriot was even worse . so i was really surprised about this one . in my opinion it is one of his very best movies . if it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be the best . i liked the story the directing and the actors . cammilla belle was just incredible . she will have a great movie career in the future . the few action scenes were very well made . and steven seagal was very believable in his unusual role .,1,0

"in my line of work , i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film . when i can , i take a look at these low budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs . once in a while , though , there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire , as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible . the short film b r o k e n , directed by alex ferrari , is a genuine surprise and worth a second look . clocking in at a scant 20 minutes , b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story . the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening . a young woman samantha jane polay awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home . when she awakes , she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book . these nasty guys and girls are larger than life . they are all guns and knives . there is no way out . the kicker here is that , despite being a low budget film it doesn't play like one . from the very beginning , the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot , edited , and produced by professionals . it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers . the film is sharp and cool , it looks good and it feels like something big . the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films . polay and paul gordon who plays the head killer , duncan were well chosen . as two of the few speaking roles in the film , it is up to them to carry the film . no special effects , no matter how good , would have saved this film from bad acting . thankfully , polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho . some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent , but it hardly shows . the downside to b r o k e n is that it's only 20 minutes long . the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle . watching it , i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany , but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be . the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop , but it comes off as unsatisfying . i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film . my rating 8 out of 10 .",1,0
"the biggest problem that the tv program key west faced was that it was advertised wrong . if you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how , and be sorely disappointed . it was a vastly more complex show than that . i happened to be in key west just before hurricane andrew hit , and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in rum runners . of course , that was before the show hit . i did see the sailboat that was in the opening go by a few times , and chatted with the guy who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too . he was a real local . yes , i'd love to see this on dvd .",1,0
"this is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired , or impaired in some other way . the acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional , and to let you know how bad the special effects are , there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet , moving it about . the movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder . when i saw this movie for the first time , a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and i were calling each other names from this flick , that's how terrible it was . if you enjoy getting mad at movies , i recommend this to you , otherwise , flee as though your very life depended on it .",1,0
"so here's a bit of background on how i came to see this movie . as you probably know , this is the original french film , that was then remade quelle surprise by hollywood as wicker park . well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released , simply because , a i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park , and living in chicago , i didn't see why they called it that it was filmed in fricking canada for a start ! b i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes , done purely because hollywood thinks we're too bone idle to read a few subtitles i am dreading the remake of infernal affairs by the way and c i can't stand josh hartnett , 'nuff said there . however , i came across wp on tv the other day , probably about half an hour in , and i have to say initially , it made no sense at all , until about half an hour from the end , when it started coming together . by the end , i was really surprised to find myself really into it , and then the ending just seemed so good a perfect combination of story , passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices i've ever seen heard ? . since then i've heard a lot about the l'appartement vs . wicker park argument and looking at wp , i still say it has bugger all to do with chicago , but there seemed something about it that i liked , so when it was on again , i watched it again unfortunately , still missing the first chunk i've still yet to see it ! , and i still thought it was pretty good . heck , even josh hartnett seemed good ! but i was curious about l'appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about . so i waited and waited to catch l'appartement somewhere somehow . netflix let me down , so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland . and i've just watched it . it's really kind of weird , but a good weird . a classic french film . great acting , romane bohringer is an absolute gem sorry , but she acts monica bellucci off the screen in every scene . vincent cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works . and i've seen jean philippe ecoffey in a lot of movies and i just love him the scene where alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his puppy's been run over was excruciating ! but , i can honestly say , having seen wp and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy as about 75 of the rest of the movie had been maybe in a different order , but come on , the scene with the coffee in the glasses ? word for word ! , you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of l'appartement ! i can literally say i was blown away hmm , a bit like poor old lucien was through the cafe window really ! so , be prepared , if you've seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did , do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie , because you'll either be disappointed , or exhilarated at a piece of french movie history a prime example of how you can watch a movie , think you're going to watch a pithy happy ending , and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end . definitely catch this movie . oh and while you're at , maybe not too near the same time , but down the road , take a look at wicker park , it'll surprise you too .",1,0
"night of the hunted stars french porn star brigitte lahaie . in fact , many of the cast members in this slow moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming . this film is certainly different than rollin's usual lesbian vampire flicks , but it's not as memorable as for example lips of blood or fascination . lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can't remember who she is or where she came from . most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex , where lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that's treating a number of people with a similar condition . anyway , she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held . on a highway outside of town , she meets a young man , who stops and picks her up . night of the hunted offers plenty of nudity , unfortunately the pace is extremely slow . the atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between brigitte lahaie and another asylum inmate dominique journet is well developed . still night of the hunted is too dull to be completely enjoyable . give it a look only if you are a fan of jean rollin's works . 7 out of 10 and that's being kind .",1,0

"remember greg the bunny ? it was this show that started on the independent film channel , but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox . my cousin and i thought it was pretty funny , beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on tv pg material . puppets who kill occurs in a similar universe , where puppets live in the same world as people , and like us , take on jobs and lives of their own . let's just say if you couldn't handle that , then don't bother watching pwk , as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of society's good graces through drug abuse , hedonism and violent felonies only to end up in a half way house . there's plenty of violence , sex , and bad language so it would never make its way to u . s . network tv . as if sociopathic puppets weren't enough , the fact that this takes place in canada makes it even more disturbing btw , the government pays for this , and i think any american television viewer would demand more demented cable tv fodder like this . i don't know where you can get it in the u . s . , beyond extra satellite tv , but i'd advise you give it a try . really funny stuff . it airs on the comedy network in canada",1,0
"i cannot hate on the show . when the old and better tech tv had to hit the bricks , the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in . attack of the show is the replacement for the screen savers , with 3 co hosts in the beginning . they were kevin rose , kevin pereira and sarah lane . brendan moran came to be something of a co host as well , but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show . kevin rose decided to leave the show , and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host , but that didn't pan out for some reason . eventually i just learned this from this very imdb messageboard sarah lane and brendan moran moved on because hey , this is what i read the two got married . that was a big secret to me ! now there is a new female co host , the not as hot my opinion olivia munn . she's hiding something in those tops she wears , while sarah lane had a perfect body and she wasn't afraid to show it . ahem ! sorry . attack of the show deals with everything young people want to know about . it's music , movies , comic books , the internet and television . this is what's great about the show . if you don't want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching mtv , you can get all you want on aots . some segments and bits they do are funny . they have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry , as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names . even though the hosts aren't as geek as i'd like them to be , i still have found attack of the show to be entertaining , even with its latest lineup .",1,0

"another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batman dead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more ! this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like ! even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts . the attention to detail , character and action is undeniably real . although this is a limited resources production , it puts to shame big budgeted , star casted , hyped productions other superhero related movies . here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people . finally , a superman that actually looks super and looks like the real thing ! batman the way it should be , without the flashy rubber casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver . i just wish that some sensible warner bros . exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel . i don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd , i would never get tired of watching it . just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this . hope the bigwigs at marvel dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look . no more batman robin fiasco , or hulk , daredevil , etc . learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to reinvent the hero for the movie , just to have it bomb in theaters . mr . collora . we need more directors like you !",1,0
"how on earth this film isn't more widely regarded is beyond me . i picked it up for 1 , and i'm not exaggerating when i say it's the best pound i've ever spent on a film . the thing that usually lets films about the club scene down is either the music or the actual scenes filmed in clubland . here , the music and club scenes are completely credible , using some big tunes of the time , and filmed in real clubs , with people actually looking like they want to be there . the performances from the actors are of a high standard all round , although jason donovan in particular for me stands out he was playing frank n furter in the rocky horror show in london at roughly the time this must have been filming , so his drag phase was in full flow ! , and of course tim curry who's eloquent drug land boss is convincing . simply put , if you're a fan of british film you have to see this , it matters not a jot if you're into clubbing as the film is strong enough as a story anyway . highly recommended .",1,0

"the brain that wouldn't die was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962 . today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959 ; the thing is both lurid and lewd , but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way . the story , of course , concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab . with the aid of a few telephone cords , a couple of clamps , and what looks very like a shallow baking pan , he brings her head back to life . but is she grateful ? not hardly . in fact , she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing , particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body . as it happens , the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed , and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks , haunting strip joints , visiting body beautiful contests , and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow . but back at the lab , the head has developed a chemically induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments , this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet . can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance , wreck revenge upon the doctor , and save the woman whose body he hankers for ? could be ! leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of spanish fly ; virginia leith , the unhappy head , screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords . busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music , actors make irrational character changes from line to line , the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot , and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs . on the whole the brain that wouldn't die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie . director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip , and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors , who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it . the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost , but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release , and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with . now , this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious , depending on your point of view , so it is very hard to give a recommendation . but i'll say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers , you need to snap this one up and now ! four stars for its cheesy bizarreness alone ! gft , amazon reviewer",1,0
"i just saw this film last night at toronto film festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section . to tell you the truth , the only reason why i went for this movie was because it shared its name with the radiohead song , and also because my friend had bought the tickets so i really didn't have a choice d i went in expecting it to be something like the silence of the lambs , but it turned out to be semi gore flick . somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable , and that is absolutely correct . i really couldn't care less if potente's character got her entrails ripped out by the creep . i was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with potente's character getting her just desserts . christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film . however , the story is rather weak , but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively . the score by a bristol band called the insects was top notch . that , more than anything else , really scared the crap out of me . the director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the q a session . i really do hope he gets to make better films in the future . this one is strictly for genre fans , but i'd recommend non fans to give this a try anyway . it was a fun ride .",1,0

"i'd never heard of this aussie horror prior to michael elliott's enthusiastic review ; in fact , after having read it , i decided to check if the dvd was available at my local rental outlet and it was albeit a german edition i . e . sans the r1 extras , so i opted to check the film out immediately . while i wouldn't go so far as to give it full marks only a select few titles get them from me , let alone an obscure modern flick i have to say that i was quite impressed with black water . rather than looking back to previous crocodile movies , such as alligator 1980 and lake placid 1999 , it evokes the memory of two which saw a small group of people who go on a trip , get lost and find themselves at the mercy of the elements and the creatures inhabiting the place namely long weekend 1978 , itself a little seen but impressive australian production , and open water 2005 . the compact , simply plotted film involves a couple and the woman's younger sister who decide to go fishing in a remote and forbidding part of the australian wilderness , known as crocodile territory ; very soon in fact , before even 15 minutes have elapsed ! , their boat is capsized and the guide killed by an alligator so our luckless adventurers take refuge up a tree . the dvd talk reviewer believes the film suffers from spending too much time in this one location with the three arguing about what they should do , attempts to retrieve the boat , seeking a way out of the jungle through the trees only to be met with nothing but water and the occasional attack by the monster . however , i think the makers take the situation as far as it will go without slipping into tedium this is due to the palpable suspense and , as michael said , the believability of the characters particularly the two women but also the fact that the crocodile here makes for one of the scariest and most memorable in recent memory i wonder how they got it to 'perform' ! i also agree with mike that the film contains some really effective shock moments the alligator leaping out of the water to take a bite at the petrified heroes ; its head suddenly emerging in front of the women as they're making for the boat ; even though one of them does reach the vehicle , the monster manages to lift its massive weight and get in the boat with her ! ; towards the end , as the same girl manages to find a gun on the mangled body of their guide , loads it and lies in wait for the alligator to appear , the latter sneaks up from behind her incidentally , the creature is bestowed with the craftiness of the shark in jaws 1975 . with this in mind , the finale is just as crowd pleasing though on an obviously smaller scale as that of the classic spielberg blockbuster even if it has a downbeat follow up . another definite asset is the film's sparse score which is generally rather lovely , but becoming unnerving at just the right moments . at the end of the day , black water emerges as a breath of fresh air in the face of the demoralizing slump into which horror cinema has fallen of late ; for this reason alone , it deserves greater exposure so as to remind us that there's hope yet for our beloved genre without the real necessity of resorting to the gimmickry of a cloverfield 2008 to command attention",1,0

"i hate reading reviews that say something like , 'don't waste your time , this film stinks on ice . ' it does to that reviewer yet for me , it may have some sort of na ve charm . if you like the other 'whistler' series films , this one will be watchable . if you like 40s noirish films , this one will be watchable . this film is not as good , in my opinion , as any of the earlier series entries which starred richard dix as the protagonist . it's much slower , and the plot is trite . you've seen this same narrative device used in many other films , and usually better . but the acting is good , and so is the lighting , and the dialog . it's just lacking in energy and you'll likely figure out exactly what's going on and how it's all going to come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way through . the 'whistler' series is semi noir , and there character , mood , lighting , camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself . but this film is not noir . it's too light weight and hollywood innocent for that . neither richard dix's character nor those of any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end . you just never knew until the end . but still , i'll recommend this one for at least a single viewing . i've watched it at least twice myself , and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it both times .",1,0
"i've seen a fair few films from the far east recently . some were excellent battle royale , infernal affairs , the eye , and some were not so great versus , the triple cross . then there are ones like uzumaki and returner , which while flawed i still enjoyed . the basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon a community . sound silly ? yeah , thats what i was thought . firstly , the good stuff . direction was top notch , sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish . secondly the story , was original and like other writers commented very lovelace esq . it was interesting . what it reminded me most of however was early cronenberg ; films like shivers and videodrome . the acting wasn't great , but not too horrible either . to be honest i was actually bored on a few occations . i felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow . my main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror , and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy . spoilers below . spoilers some good scenes washing machine and i liked the final shot voiceover . at first i thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later i realised the meaning and liked the end . however , because of the lack of seriousness in the story , combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that i did not care for the characters much in the end . the final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little poignent , while in reality i couldn't really care for the girl or her boyfriend . spoilers end so overall i kinda did like this film , but it frustrated me and i think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes . couple of other points , the main girl is quite pretty and cute , and the song that plays at the end is good too . i rated it 7 10 .",1,0
"those of the instant gratification era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film's pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count . the fact is , the empty acre is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done . if you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back story could have come off the back of a count chocula box , the empty acre is the movie for you . set in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream , the empty acre is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six month old baby . as the couple's weak relationship falls apart , a larger story plays out in the background . at night , a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path , leaving no sign that it was ever there . the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening , and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer director's faith in an intellectual audience . there seems to be a sub text concerning the death of the american dream , but i would hardly call the film an allegory . riveting , well acted , and technically astute , the empty acre is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love .",1,0

"im not a big tim matheson fan but i have to admit i liked this film . it was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy , i don't know were to classify this film its a bit sf and a bit horror slash thriller . i saw this at about 2 . 00am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it . if you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that bad , the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more better . i don , t know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for tv or went straight to video , i for one would buy this if it , s on dvd it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the x files story attached to it . government undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealings . overall a good film .",1,0
"contains spoilers hollow man is probably the weakest movie that paul verhoeven , director of great movies like total recall , starship troopers and robocop has ever made . that's probably not his fault . for some reason , verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script , and he made the best of it . the first part of this movie is rather good , with lots of cynical jokes , great special effects and even skunk anansie on the soundtrack . unfortunately , the movie falls flat in the second part , were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad alien clone . the ending is especially ridiculous , as kevin bacon keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should in the logical sense of the word have killed him . . and the entire thing is quite shallow , indeed the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated . but all in all , verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie . 1 2 out of stars",1,0
"goebbels motivation in backing down was not explored . in the aftermath of stalingrad the reich had decided to go for 'total war' . this is referred to in the film . part of this was to use women in the war effort , which germany had not previously done to any great extent . an ss massacre of women would have faced goebbels with a public relations disaster of massive proportion . his preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible , on the basis that the jewish men could always be rounded up later . i understand the majority survived the war . his other problem was that the 'red' berlin had never been very enthusiastically behind the nazi cause and had to be handled cautiously . again a massacre of women could have cost the nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city . it was interesting that the majority of ss uniforms showed patches which indicated that the men wearing them were not of german nationality , but were from german origins in other countries such as lithuania or latvia",1,0
"i went into this movie knowing nothing about it , and ended up really enjoying it . it lacked authenticity and believability some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre , and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad libbed perhaps this is typical of woody allen ? excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard . it wasn't even at the jokes in the movie per se , but at the whole movie itself . the acting reminded me of seinfeld's acting , where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes they are corny , but if you don't take the movie too seriously , you can really appreciate the humour of the actors , not the characters . if you're looking for a random movie , and you like woody allen , i'd definitely recommend it !",1,0
"i have to admit to enjoying bad movies . i love them i watch all of them . horror especially . my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work , rent some crazy tapes , order a pizza and have a blast . one of the ones we got at hollywood video , was this one , zombie bloodbath . this one had a great box , so i was expecting less than usual . the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above ground layers bulldozed , and the other underground layers are simply covered up . the inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave . this wakes up some zombies . from this point on , it's chunk city . the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll . ok , it's not great art , but this one , with it's in joke dialogue and over the top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening . actually , it was one of the best party tapes i have ever had the pleasure of watching . and you could tell it was done on no money , with a bunch of crazy people . there are hundreds of zombies , and the director looks like brendan frazer he has a cameo and it is just a wild trip .",1,0
"i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable . the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft core porn . in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks . perhaps for sex as well , but not on indian tv , anyway . not being a fan of the genre i couldn't place jeff wincott , and had no leads to search from . only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic nurse coif so mayoral ! for the high top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on her . this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90's couture or nod and wink schlock la paul verhoeven . can we add a genre tag for so bad it's good ?",1,0
"let's face it , you know what to expect when you tune into a post 1990 corey feldman film , there are probably boobs , guns and cars . saying that , there is more to this movie than just naked ladies i'm sorry to say , cos it's mainly people getting themselves killed in a variety of unusual , and as the name suggests , often 'mystical' ways . i love crappy horror , and i love this film . if you don't , you probably wont . but i think it's worth most people giving it a go , it's not so crappy that it'll ruin your weekend or anything . all in all , if its mindless good fun , a bit of corpse loving , and an 80's childhood superstar your in the mood for , then you've come to the right place . its a cracker !",1,0
"this is a totally awesome movie ! if you haven't seen it yet , you damn well should . sure , the plot is slow to develop , the special effects are laughable , the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed , but as wrestler ddp would say ; that's not a bad thing . that's a good thing ! everything about this movie is hilarious , especially if you get the dubbed version , which has even worse actors . it's countless laughs until you get to the end , yearning for the sequel , where the mummy fights wrestling women . thus , i give it ten stars . unless you're one of those 'discriminating' and 'intelligent' people with good taste , who likes only 'high quality' films of the highest calibre , i recommend this utterly monkeydellic movie !",1,0
"the plot starts out interesting , however , towards the end too many die in too short a time , turning the thriller mystery aspect of the story into a slaughter . the only true highlights were adam beach and j rgen prochnow , who were once again their excellent selves . nice try with an inappropriate last third , though a good ending .",1,0
"first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in . 1995 . rappers were in it , and that added to the flair of it . remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't , until he met and was befriended by nazis . they took him in . nazi's aren't all this awkward , but like most gangs , they fill a void that is missing be it economic , social , emotional , whatever . michael rappaport played the part perfectly . omar epps was the hot shot track star , with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder . he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight , and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it . kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in , until she was date raped . she then found her self experiment with her sexuality , and getting involved politically . this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism , people's own perspectives come into play . i read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one nazis . so what ? remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all , he was trying to find his way , and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him . he was scared , it was sad to see him devolve how he did . he even says right before he kills himself , i didn't mean it , i wanted to be an engineer . ice cube and busta rhymes were angry black men , ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual , and busta rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug . they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates , and generally appear to not like white people very much . they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness . sorry if this makes it seem unfair , but are there really black groups like the nazis ? no . people say it shows white bad black good . not true , the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police , which is more or less true in real life . kristen was a good girl , her boyfriend omar epps roommate was a good guy , and even remy was a good guy , he was just misguided . omar epps , ice cube and busta were seriously flawed characters , angry and inconsiderate . although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger . remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well . good movie , well done . like all movies that deal with racism , its a great piece to get a discussion going . i don't think cube and busta coulda beat those nazis though .",1,0

"one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun exciting for the cast and crew ; i could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm dedication because they apparently liked the people involved . i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart , and i think this is one such work . the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual , maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress director , and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent , watchable piece of art . the critiques of this film that more or less say , why not just rent a hardcore porn movie , make the point as to why they didn't like the film . going to this film hoping for a lot of t a without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them . one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie , even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn . i think she graduated . in terms of the writing , the dialog is not a huge part of the movie , like in a tarentino film , but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun . particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure , with the villianess heroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings . i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this . hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride . gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot , not just airhead bimbos , so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art , even with the limits of b movie land , not disappointing .",1,0

"separate lies changed my life . actually , the q a did . spoilers below . read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it the emily watson character cheats on the tom wilkonson character . my first reaction to the puppy dog eyed emily was it's over . dump her . bad riddance . for some reason , he stuck around . not in a pathetic way . he just listened . and tried to accept her needs . at times he needed to leave . but he stuck by her and let her live her life . but i still wanted to see her afterwards , julian , the screenwriter and director , talked about the film . i'm glad he did , because frankly i am too you and was too immature to get the point before he broke it down for me . tom's character loved her , and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs might disagree with what he wants , he would always love her . the relationship and love they shared wasn't a lie , all of a sudden , just because she wanted to be with someone else . the fact that she wanted to be with someone else didn't make her who she was . when you get past fifty , there's a strong chance that finding the love of your life won't come around again , so you can't be as dismissive as you were when you were younger . you have to try and make things work , because the alternative may be much worse . she needed what she needed , and she couldn't help that . he had to learn to let go of her if he wanted to be the full man he could be . he helped her in pursuit of her lover , even when it hurt him . another thing julian said that the strongest tool of a controller is guilt . again the strongest tool of a controller is guilt . at the end of the film , tom released her from her burden . he felt a need to let her know that he loved her , but not to in order to get her back ; he wanted to let her know she didn't need to feel guilty or think poorly about the relationship , just because it ended in such a terrible way . it is not my way to review a film based on the message , rather than the execution , especially when i understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director , but i make an exception here , as i feel one more mature than i would benefit from seeing the film . the execution of the film making was a nice , british pace . rupert was slimy and revolting . tom and emily were their usually solid , real characters .",1,0

"i just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all i can say is . what did i just watch ? and i mean that in a good and bad way . the plot is really simple . stiller and black play friends neighbors . stiller is the focused , hardworker while black is a dreamer . black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo . the idea becomes very popular , and black becomes very rich . the extravagant lifestyle that black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with stiller causes stiller to become crazy with envy . as i said , the plot is simple . everything else is plain odd . the direction is odd , with a weird rotating opening shot to out of nowhere sped up sequences . the dialouge and the acting is very odd ; odd in a rambling sort of way . and the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie , from the weird envy song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think you're going to hear a classic 80's song but suddenly it's in japanese . so , the true question is this . is odd funny ? that depends purely on the individual . i was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie . after the screening i heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free . strangely , i understood their point . there are no jokes whatsoever , so if you aren't hooked by the uniqueness of it all , you will hate this movie . absolutely hate it . this movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a dvd cult classic . if you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes , like cable guy or punch drunk love , then i suggest you see it . if you don't , run away from this movie . it'll only make you mad .",1,0
"the movie actually has a fairly good story , but gets bogged down in several key places . it's almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film . dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role . but something is clearly missing from several key scenes . this 2 . 5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie . and probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together .",1,0

"i'm a fan of c c , going back to their records , and liked this movie , but at one point in the mid 1980's on cable television in san jose california , it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie . all references to marijuana were replaced with diamonds . the bag that red drops to chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana , but the conversation still remains the same . it's worth 3000 lb . there is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing c c , and talking to each other about getting the diamonds . at the end , instead of space coke , it's something else . i'm not sure who created this version , but it was horrible , and obvious that they were attempting to make it family child friendly . it would have been better if that network had not aired it at all .",1,0

"this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more . crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother . they have never worked before and the brother , william bakewell , gets a job with gable , who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick . crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on . their is a massacre in which several of gable's men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing . it's a good movie but not one of their best .",1,0
"the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek a dose of realistic , flawed personalities . the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring , they were so noble as to be unbelievable . i also like the sub plot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans . its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs . it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two , though i don't think it would work in the time frame of the show . the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end , which is common among many of the trek shows . the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes . it was out of place , a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre teen audience with some skin . but its not my job to make the show profitable , so oh well . lets see how the next episode does .",1,0
"as this movie is completely in swiss dialect , it's probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie . i'm not from switzerland , but i worked there for some years , so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings . i've seen a lot of movies of this kind eg . scary movie , loads of scifi spoofs etc . but this one is the best one of that kind , i've seen so far . i give a 9 of 10 . the only reason i can't give a 10 is , because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd , so there's almost no chance for non swiss to understand .",1,0
"as i said in my comment about the first part these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess . the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization , but the aftermath , thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans , protected by only one powerful spaceship . but when battlestar pegasus appears , the story heats up , carrying the battle back to the cylon planets . okay , it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth , but it works for me . it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects even though those tend to repeat themselves , to say the least . i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board . instead , we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well chosen . so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 , but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978 .",1,0
"comanche moon had everything going for it . for starters , simon wincer's back , a man who's name is synonymous with high quality tv westerns . unfortunately , the problems with moon are something even the most talented director couldn't solve a poor script based on a lackluster novel . forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you , the biggest travesty in moon is that it's not even consistent with information from the original lonesome dove masterpiece . so many wonderful , rich moments in the miniseries and , to an even greater degree , the book , are completely missing in moon . considering the fact that most viewers of moon are probably coming with at least some sort of dove background , the lack of character driven and emotional backstory is downright painful . that said , moon is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen . for example , the novel moon focuses largely on the comanches themselves . to its credit , the miniseries tries to service the comanches , but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story . similarly , val kilmer's scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so kilmer and rachel griffiths , for that matter actually had something to do , or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller , supporting parts . instead , kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act . there's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book a killer parrot ? what ? further , there isn't a single scene that shows us that call and mccrae are anything near the amazing texas rangers they claim to be . not a single one of their expeditions in moon or dead man's walk , for that matter ends successfully , and call and mccrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another . frankly , larry mcmurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script , and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie , brokeback mountain . mcmurtry can write good novels although there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement , but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter . this production would have benefited from not only bringing back director wincer , but original screenwriter bill wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen . witcliff doesn't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit , but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original lonesome dove . with all this said , comanche moon is almost a brilliant production , aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do . steve zahn's portrayal of gus mccrae or rather , his portrayal of robert duvall as gus mccrae is dead on . and while some have criticized karl urban as woodrow call , saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet , stoic woodrow of the original movie , all i can say is blame mcmurtry , because mcmurtry is the one who both in the moon novel and now the miniseries turned woodrow from socially inept , awkward , but natural leader , into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel . still , it's the cast that sparkles in moon , to the degree that i left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy i felt watching the original lonesome dove this time because i realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long , long time to come and quite honestly , this cast could have done so well in a well nurtured , full blown network tv series . all in all , aside from wasted opportunities with the cast , the biggest travesty is that the original lonesome dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating , utterly fascinating , to see translated on screen . unfortunately , all that has been tossed aside in favor of mcmurtry's tedious , inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant , prequel .",1,0
"this is a cute little horror spoof comedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira mistress of the dark , the most infamous horror hostess of all time . this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network . they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit com never made it past the pilot stage due to it's sexual references . this film however , is very amusing . elvira is the modern day chesty morgan and the queen of the one liners . this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal elvira's haunted hills which was meant to be a take off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on it's face . watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience !",1,0

"hrm i think that line was from the old movie posters . this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator . here's a tip any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading in the future . is going to be fun . this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you . in this case , in the future . means that , instead of fighting wars , nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine , well , that's never terribly clear , but it's probably something really important . there are good guys obviously capitalists , i . e . us and bad guys commies ! and there are big stop motion robots . sadly , the effects budget was pretty slim , so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots . there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes , and then a big space fight near the end . the space fight is especially nice , as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget . with said money now spent , the climactic fight degenerates into and i'm not making this up two guys hitting each other with sticks . i can always get a laugh in a bar by re enacting the final scene , complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads . like i said it's dumb . that's why i bought the tape .",1,0
"thank you the filmzone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 a . m . i truly enjoyed it . to be honest , i expected a lot more from a sexy cast with mckayla , dru berrymore , and of course , the talented chloe nicholle as rebecca carter . the production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort wouldn't harm . for example , the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie . there's absolutely no effort in lightning . but let's ignore that fact because let's be honest , we watched pleasures of sin because of the high amounts of sex . the sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy , explicit scenes . chole nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast . so my advice is , watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of mrs . nicholle . recommended only for the sex scenes ; don't expect anything else .",1,0
"as a non theist im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago . safe to say , science is based on evidence , religion is based on blind faith . nuff said there then . the film was produced by the bbc , and to be honest , it could quite easily have been shown on television . while the acting is superb , the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release . that said , if it reaches a wider audience this way , then so be it . but i have seen many period style dramas on bbc tv and they were well up to the finished standard of this . just don't expect too much of a big budget thrill ride when going to see it . in some ways , i found the movie almost going out on a limb to apologise to religious fundamentalists . while it attains a good sense of tension the whole way through , i couldn't help wanting it to get to the publication of the origin of species much quicker than it actually did you'll wait right until the end for that . and it seemed to dwell much more than i was ever aware on darwin's struggle with himself and his wife emma , portraying him almost as some kind of insane lunatic at times which is hardly true . there are many other errors and facts missing in relation to the real story of the lead up to the publication of origin too , but the whole premise of the movie focuses almost entirely on the difficulty darwin faced domestically with the book , and a small portion on the death of his beloved daughter annie . this gives the film its most moving scene , where annie passes away as she asks one final time to hear darwin tell her the story of a captive orangutan which died of pneumonia . though , you'll probably feel a bigger connection with the primate in that scene than with darwin's daughter . with the early controversy apparently surrounding the movie in the usa it will work well to promote it and ensure many more people will get to see it . but to be honest , there is actually very little in it that insults any mythical godhead . its hardly headline news about a theory that has been around 150 years after all . but , as fundamental christians and many other religions which we're all well aware of like to wave a placard or two whenever possible , i guess this movie is as good excuse as any . personally , i cant see what all the fuss is about . but maybe they're just monkeying around .",1,0

"i saw anatomy years ago dubbed at a friends house i don't remember it much , and then i saw at the video store there is a second one not really related to the first one franka ponte makes a little cameo . and that one was okay not as good as the first one . i'm seeing the first one again tonight not dubbed collectors edition . i really like german movies like this one it's very interesting and people and cults like the one in the movie could exist i think , i dunno . but it's very grossly entertaining and scary . anatomy 2 is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first . but if you really thought anatomy was interesting and good you should see the second one .",1,0
"i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod . if you don't expect anything else , such as clever plot twists and believable character development , you won't be disappointed . consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people , especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy' suzanna arquette , who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten she leaves that up to her daughter . mandy's face is a little too perfect , but her body is a complete 5 alarm fire , up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness , a perfect 7 to 10 ratio of waist to hips , and splendidly configured legs , right down to her feet . there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye ; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio . and no flat butt to boot , which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres' . mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle lit hot tub with her blindfolded german guy victim no . 2 , but from all i could see from her bikini shots , she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it . mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl' , with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones . her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no . 2 , who also happened to be her mother's lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise one dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason . mandy's uber nordic facial features coupled with her uber voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse . if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress , i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages , especially italian and spanish and maybe french , although i don't know if they would go for her type . but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic , and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground . vambo drule .",1,0
"many people have said that this movie was not a good movie , at a horror perspective i agree , it was not very scary , it did have some gruesome ways of torture yes hooks going where they shouldn't but not scary . but it was a good movie at a comedic stand point , i thought it was hilarious , such bad acting from dee snider with his stupid theological questioning and every second word he said came out as what is , define , then the angry mob at his house with one of them holding a sign saying we're not gonna take it which is a song from his band twisted sister . but i think the part that made me laugh the most was the one guy's wife that was dead and dee snider was holding her up and making her dance , when i saw that i broke out in tears . so i would not recommend this for avid horror lovers , but for those who love horror for its comedy i recommend this movie 100",1,0
"honestly , i was expecting to hate this one , and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it . but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed . a group of college kids and their teacher go on a field trip to ireland . their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace . the group of post teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods but being the stupid b movie characters that they are of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one by one . first off , there is plenty wrong with evil breed . the acting dialog is pretty weak , and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson , chasey lain , ginger lynn , and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here and jenna's role in this production is grossly over hyped , as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time . even less with chasey , and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever . also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film . those gripes aside there is some good stuff as well . richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on , with greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey's guts hanging out from being torn in half though how she ends up this way isn't shown on screen . not bad for the first 5 minutes . the other kill scenes are pretty inventive , including jenna's forced breast implant removal , a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass , a knife through the face , and a few other notables . the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em , so to speak . also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored . the creature fx are also done competently which definitely helps . overall , evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected . this one , along with satan's little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low budget straight to video films . i usually steer clear of them as a whole , but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith . evil breed is no masterpiece , but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it i know i was , and i'm sure it didn't hurt the experience . 7 . 5 10",1,0

"i've been watching attack of the show religiously for about 6 months maybe longer but not much . i was very infatuated with olivia and i found kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good . lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me . first my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called around the net , that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like youtube , that are generally funny , or of people getting hurt inadvertently some intentionally . umm , this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same stuff , i really haven't seen anything that good and i can only laugh at people actually probably breaking their necks and being paralyzed so many times . the show is like a late show wanna be colbert report wanna be with it's politics also , if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal , this humor gets old also , mccain is old , yeah yeah , whatever . libs have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that would endear themselves as having a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves , so it's almost every show bash mccain or palin , sheesh . so we get the same old vids of people getting hurt that we are supposed to keep laughing at and then some leftist political humor that never laugh's at itself out of it's own weakness . i'll keep watching since i watch at work and it's all that's on , hoping that i'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old . i did like the fill in host's of chris and alison though , they were actually a good change of pace ; maybe this show could do a rotating host thing . olivia who i thought at times in the beginning was really funny has resorted to this constant pouting response and it's getting old , lol . 7 of 10 ; it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger baby boomer like me mid 40's . maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do , there is a ton of stuff available they could use .",1,0

"it's taken years for cult icon bruce campbell to get this project off the ground but he finally has , it's here and what a great piece of schlock entertainment it is ! looking at the plot ; it sounds like two things . a great base for a very silly b movie , and a shameless excuse for bruce campbell to what he does best evil dead ii style slapstick humour , and this film delivers on both counts . the man with the screaming brain is comic book nonsense all the way through but there's some really great scenes , and it's almost impossible to be bored with this movie . bruce campbell wrote , directs , produces and stars in this film and while it's not quite citizen kane , it has to be said that this is an achievement for the man most famous for battling off his own hand in a woodland cabin . the plot follows american businessman william cole on a business trip to bulgaria with his girlfriend . the trip goes awry , however , when he , his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead ; thanks to the same woman . mad scientist stacy keach is on hand to merge cole and the taxi driver's brains into one ; and we've got a cult flick on our hands . the first half hour or so is entertaining and features a few laughs ; but once the main plot point has been executed ; the movie really picks up . bruce makes best use of the scenario in all kinds of silly situations , from changing his clothes in a waste bin , to deciding with the taxi driver in his brain what to eat in a restaurant . the humour is mostly of the slapstick variety , and anyone who enjoyed evil dead ii which should be anyone who's seen it , will no doubt enjoy this too . it does feel like campbell is playing to his strengths a little bit too much with this whole project , but if you tuned in and didn't see bruce doing what he does best , disappointment would ensue . besides that , no disrespect to the man ; but he's never been the actor with the greatest range . despite being lots of fun ; the movie isn't great , as it gets a little bit too silly at times ; and there's a whole sub plot with a robot that i didn't like ; but overall , the man with the screaming brain is a film that we , sadly , don't see too much of nowadays . the film is an all out , no holds barred , b movie ; and it deserves respect for that if nothing else .",1,0
"i don't watch a lot of tv , except for the office , weeds , entourage and e !

"ok , it's easy not to confuse this with the lame stuart gordon movie called death bed that came out a few years back , because this one is the bed that eats . and how do i even begin to describe this ? well , for starters , obviously there is a bed that eats . this is as a result of demon teardrops , which of course affect most things , i guess , in a negative way . the bed is in some old servant's quarters or something , and has been responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people in its time . we have a narrator , who is a ghost that sits in the wall behind a painting , and collects all the non edible goodies jewelry , etc that the bed passes on . he died of consumption , one of the few people to lay in the bed that didn't get eaten , probably because he was sick , he theorizes , as we see him hacking blood into hankies . bleah . the thing about this movie is that is has a very odd sense of humor to it but it's all played pretty deadpan . the movie is divided into several acts , i guess , breakfast , lunch , dinner , just desserts . for fans of the unfathomably weird and bizarre , well , this may just be right up your alley . all i can say is you have to see this one to believe it , it pretty well defies description . 8 out of 10 stars .",1,0
"as much as 'the beginning' showed that we're still going to get classic x files , drive showed that the x files was going to explore new territory . they start by giving us a unique teaser to drive , with the news camera footage . it was an interesting transition from the the tv to the real events . i would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car . upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 i was thinking , am i on the right channel ? that first autopsy by scully flooded me with big words that i don't understand . i think she learned her lesson to always wear a mask before performing an autopsy . silly scully ! what is the deal with the lighting in the autopsy lab ? it's as dark as a tomb in there ! how are they supposed to see what they're doing in there ? assistant director kersh gets his first lines in this episode . i have no love lost for that man . he is the third recurring character in a row that is introduced that you love to hate , the first two being diana fowley and jeffrey spender . i guess the producers felt that there was too much love going on for mulder , scully and skinner . so they needed to add some characters to give our favorite agents some grief and incite our ire as fans . i love the quarantine suits worn by scully and her team with the cool helmet light bulbs . boy . it's really smoky or foggy in dry northern nevada at night . can we say the word effect ? drive is a cool episode , but looking at route 36 on my u . s . atlas , there's no way mulder could've maintained a speed of 70 100 mph on that road . if he had been on i 80 , the freeway , maybe . but no way on a state road with that many curves . all of the filming inside the car looked very authentic . excellent job by rob bowman . it looks nothing like the old days of the obvious blue screen or clip of passing scenery outside a car window on a stage . this was a fun episode , but some of the inaccuracies keep it from being a great episode . it keeps you on the edge of your seat , so hold on for a fast ride !",1,0
"i love kristen dunst , especially in elizabethtown . i guess she's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera , but just be herself . she did that , and she looked so natural in elizabethtown . in this movie , however , she did try to add in more artificial performance , especially in the first half of the film , so that she looked more like a sober editor . while in the other half , she totally set herself back in her daily track , and i just couldn't tell her to be an editor any way . therefore , her performance is not enduring in this film . the film , on the whole , is attracting and inspiring . the character of young is full and reasonable . anyway , the film tells a big and sophisticated story . the only big defect is that it didn't show a turning point of the hero and heroine's love story . i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story , because that is rather unclear for the two persons .",1,0
"having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons , i believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference . though the themes are crusty and stale to today's viewers , it is by no means a crumby waste of time . though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse , the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough . as noted by another reviewer , it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy , sit back and loaf idly through the film . i think this short bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it .",1,0

"time and time again , i've stated that if people don't want remakes or sequels made , they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film . having said that though , the last time i saw an independent film myself must have been easily six months ago . so here's a review for an indie that i had my attention drawn to on youtube ; the cure . right away , you can tell that the film is going for an avant garde film approach which is telegraphed in its use of extreme close ups , scopophilia and fast editing . it is proud of the way it looks and it has a right to be . for the most part it is a very nicely composed little piece , save for one inexcusable disregard for the 180 degree rule and a comically bad gunshot effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self funded projects . still , despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at . we're presented with a good use of props and locations , good visual acting and some very atmospheric , fluid editing , which is made more commendable as this is definitely something you won't see very often at all from a youtube submission . the plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening , but what we are seeing here is avant garde storytelling at work ; you can't really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of movie . where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound . what you're going to hear throughout is a distorted voice over which often sounds insincere and worse still is the continuous background music , which goes through minimal change and doesn't add much to anything . so much attention is paid to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected , and this becomes really apparent when you realize you've just missed about four sentences of the narration and have to backtrack to pick up what slipped past your attention . so , give it a watch , but do it with the sound turned off . last thought ; was anyone else reminded of the cover for doug naylor's red dwarf novel last human early in the film ? if you have the book you know what i mean .",1,0

"so forgive the really lame game play scene , cardboard background and studio like stadium . for this part i should have give the movie 5 instead of 7 , but read on . from the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with the replacements . some say this movie rip off the replacements , while some say this script wrote before it . both movies require some sort of suspension of disbelief on the basic premise , and this is especially difficult for second string since it has nfl license team and all the history behind it . food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people , and not to mention in second string bills has to overcome big scores again and again , with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene , this make it look even bad . in replacements , the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life . i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event oh yeah , this happen before ! , rather than real setting background with fictional scenario there is no way bill can win a superbowl ! ; some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of raven games , real stadium , real audience and some nfl match alike shooting angle . but let say both movies came out on the same day , and we erase the budget factor thus forgive the game play action scene overall , i like second string over replacements , not by much , but i like this more . it has relatively better character development . in replacements , keanu character is too out sync with the world , and all he care is maybe , get a girl ? in second string you see the struggle of the qb from getting the job back , and deal with his past with coach . or the fumble guy problem . this hold the ball all day long solution of course is not new , but we see progression in fixing it . how about those trick play ? i think it is relatively realistic than replacements . the dan marino like fake knee pass , flea flicker , wild cat full back rush , all real , except sometimes this look a bit too easy . but for me it is better than replacement 's center catch and rushing for 50 yards call , or how a 60 yards field goal look too easy . oh btw , i am glad they didn't force the te kicker made his shot . of course if you objectively review this movie over other football movies all there , this could easily be a 5 out of 10 movie . but some say this is the worse football movie ? try the comebacks .",1,0
"this movie has to be my favorite of all time . its not supposed to have a plot , because its makers wanted people charlie sheen , i think to believe it was a real snuff film . this was an exercise in visual effects , and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does . movies these days are now all about sound effects , leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood . there still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing . there is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film . have you seen the hills have eyes 2 ? the rape scene was funny instead of shocking . although i'm sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror . but since they probably suck at making films , they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off . the movie baise moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks . its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all , especially when talking about an ao or nc 17 rating . i'm sure eli roth has the ability talent to make his hostel film series much much better , but he has too tame it down to get an r rating . or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations . watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident crime scenes footage . don't forget that this movie was made in 1985 . the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film . that would be like someone saying the 8bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps3 has better graphics .",1,0

"i've seen this movie more than once . it was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in television movies back then . the only problem i had was with the title for the obvious reasons . one immediately thinks of the famous snack cake by drake's ! leaving off the first part , 'hound of hell' would have sufficed . richard crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does , anyway whether the plot is good or bad . but this was an enjoyable halloween fare offered by the cbs network . i loved the part where crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast . he asks the cab driver how to find this guy . great dialogue between the native cab driver and crenna in terms of the cabby dissing his own people's ethnic beliefs . 'aw , mr . barry , i left that stuff behind when i came down from the mountains . ' referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people , and nobody knows how to really contact him . as far as supernatural fare goes , this movie is still enjoyable .",1,0
"go way back to page ten of this review section , and work your way back up . go ahead ; i'll wait . done ? well , then you've probably noticed the same trend that i have . you could nitpick all day long about the lame jokes , dated timing and obviously derivative plot points and shtick in 'bogus' , but this movie seems to be one of those 'hate me now , love me later flicks . bill and ted's biggest problem was that the original appealed to those 80's kids who followed the tends and considered themselves on the cutting edge of fashion . that worked fine for the original , but obviously bombed in 1991 , when no self unrespecting slacker would be caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting he liked anything about the 80's . as ted would put it dude , this is a totally deep hole . wanna play 20 questions ? they say nostalgia goes in 20 year cycles , and that certainly seems to be the case here . here in 2010 , those of use who grew up with cindi lauper and megadeth are beginning to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that like it or not made us who we are . if you're one of those who look at 'bogus' as if it were an outdated fa gs ! ripoff , then you're missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair , wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed . in self referencing its own origins the star trek episode and and time traveling with a phone booth , b t makes no attempt to hide its creators' love for homage . quentin tarantino , anyone ? i'm not saying 'bogus' is 'true love , ' but i do think it needs to be appreciated for what it is a fun snap shot of our society at a time before child psychology , ritalin , anti smoking ads , terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media fear mongering . so , for all of you b t haters out there . turn off your screaming trees cd , get that hair out of your face , go to the beach and lighten up . narcissistic depression and intellectual ennui are so corporate .",1,0

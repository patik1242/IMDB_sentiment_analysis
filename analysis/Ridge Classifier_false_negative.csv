"i'm not here to tell you armored is kubrickian , hitchcockian or fellini esquire . nope . referenced directors are more like don siegel charlie varrick and walter hill the warriors . those two helmers didn't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies . no skirts need apply . they unapologetically made guy movies . guns , lots of guns . men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw . their movies were like a sap to the head . you want a friend ? get a dog . armored is so a guy movie . dueling armored trucks ? bloody gunshot wounds ? exploding money ? if that doesn't get the lizard part of your brain excited , then stay away . at 88 minutes , armored is all muscle without an ounce of fat . we meet six security guards who drive armored trucks , three per truck . the six , led by matt dillon , scheme up a fake hijack involving two trucks . their mission one day is to deliver 42 million from the federal reserve i think . the idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse , stash the cash , then stage a hijack . sure , the cops will suspect them , but if they stick together they'll get through it . trouble is , one of the six , played by columbus short , is a holdout . at first . but he faces eviction . and he's the guardian for his messed up younger brother . he needs cash bad . matt dillon cajoles , pleads , persuades the holdout . no blood on anyone's hands . a clean getaway . all good , no bad . you'll be rich forever . blue skies smiling at you . right . everything goes to hell , of course . it's one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up . and it almost all happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in los angeles . in fact , the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay . i happen to like industrial urban decay . kudos to matt dillon , who plays the top bad dog . he goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally effing insane in the course of the movie . love that guy . also , credit is due to the menacing , throbbing , blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by john murphy . i am guessing he's heard a few tangerine dream records . also , it's surprising that this is a pg 13 movie . i caught one one ! f bomb in this entire movie about violent tough guy robbers . on some level , i like that . take the kids . the director is nimrod antal , a hungarian who made a fine noir set in the budapest subway system called kontroll . screenwriter is an out of nowhere guy called james v . simpson . a lot of the people in this movie are just starting out . i am willing to bet the esteem given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers .",1,0
"as far as christian film goes , it's typical . lacking of a mega budget they try their best . some times falling short , sometimes hitting the mark . this one almost hit , great acting can only carry a movie so far . a combining of h . p . lovecraft , and frank peretti was a good idea . all's it needed was better back story , and better character development to make it great movie . the visuals are not that bad , also smart holding off the demons till the last few minutes helped keep the suspense at a good pace . could of used a better ending though . not a bad premise having terrorists experiments go wrong . much better than typical hollywood treatment about the demonic realm . maybe someone will finally do this present darkness as a movie .",1,0
"this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . that would be fine if the film were a travelogue , but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry , that is not good enough . the theme of inter species respect and co operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter species love , but its approach is stereotypical , indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species . as with many films , one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter . alas , we probably will never know .",1,0
"born again is a okay episode of season 1 . the reincarnation bit , in my opinion , is cool . the more i watch it , the more i like it , yet it will never rise above 'very good' for me . even though it is not very memorable , i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode . anyway , now i will say what is good and bad about this episode , the good oragami . oh yeah ! that fish tank was nice . thrown out of a window . very classy . x the bad marry your best friend's wife ! ? o o what a random pick to reincarnate . why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up , try to take his scarf off instead ? conclusion okay episode , not very memorable . 7 10",1,0
"hmmmm , want a little romance with your mystery ? this has it . i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie . but how could the romance be ditched when the story's borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel , whatever the heck that is . had the romance been ditched , the story might have been a little too weak . the mystery here wasn't too bad , quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage . oh well . i thought mel harris was pretty good ; her short skirts , i think , added some sex appeal . but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast , maybe with a more well known tv movie actor . the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on both could have been a little edgier , a little darker , more adventurous . one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations . that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest . possibly a drawback was the director and or cinematographer's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect . not good . had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen , picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background . this was just a tv movie , though , so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery . overall , twasn't really a bad movie . i'll tell you what , this was absolutely the best canadian hungarian production i have ever seen ! and the only that i know of . i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made for tv movie , giving it a grade of c",1,0

"i found this film to be the usual french slap in america's face . the camera , all too often , focuses on fat people , on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas . while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer , the cinematography exploits and demeans them . there were , undoubtedly , thin people to be seen in glencoe and neat , organized homes , but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen . i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements . i can assure you , as a frequent visitor to france , that all is not well there . foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated , thus creating severe social inequities . but americans are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the u . s . , so we're not likely to see films on the subject .",1,0

"vincent price's follow up to house of wax 1953 , the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon , similarly revolves around a bitter albeit resourceful showman . though a remake , the former shot in technicolor remains the superior effort ; that said , apart from some resistible comic relief , the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry it was another 3 d showcase and occasional narrative shortcomings whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head ? , this offers more than enough grand guignol type thrills and overall camp value price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating 'missing' star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius to stand on its own two feet . incidentally , director brahm's involvement here proves no mere coincidence since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles both starring laird cregar he had previously helmed i . e . the lodger 1944 and hangover square 1945 . the young leads are played by mary murphy as price's ing nue assistant and patrick o'neal as her police detective boyfriend curiously enough , he would himself take the lead in a similar piece , chamber of horrors 1966 , which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one . an interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a novel detection technique , fingerprinting , which is crucial in bringing about price's downfall in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run ! watching the star in a made to measure role , the film emerges a good deal of fun particularly at a compact 73 minutes .",1,0
"distant is a slice of turkish life flick which follows the mundane activities of two adult male cousins ; one a photographer and the other an unemployed underachiever . there's little doubt that auteur nuri bilge ceylan is a work in progress with considerable talent . however , this little foreign minimalistic arty dramady is so full of empty filler and so devoid of story or anything engaging or provocative that it will likely appeal to only the most avid devotees of cinema and mainstream audiences should look elsewhere . i personally grew quickly bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself fast forwarding through the empty spaces and there are many between dialogue , plot development , and denouement . distant is a very nicely done bit of esoterica . b",1,0
"watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s , a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as die hard in a on a . cliffhanger is die hard on a mountain , and pretty good , for what it is . but unlike passenger 57 and under siege , which are decent die hard clones on their own terms , cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that , in their immensity , threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks . years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations , cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings . the opening sequence has already received substantial praise , all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening . not even harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal , which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in deep blue sea , or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite's face , can dim the sequence's power . the next impressive set piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet . as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin , the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody double crosses are completely unexpected . as roger ebert has observed , the stuntman who made the mid air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition . later , during the avalanche sequence , one of the terrorists thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain . so far as i know , no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle , considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts , so obviously a dummy was used for the shot . but the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how harlin or more likely one of the second unit directors knew exactly where to place the camera . i'll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week , because he's one of the few movie stars i've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain , and at the same time actually feels that pain . the role of gabe walker really complements stallone's acting strengths he plays an older , more vulnerable kind of action hero , giving an impressively low key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself . in contrast to many of today's post matrix , comic book inspired action heroes , stallone's walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer enhanced abilities . in cliffhanger , the hero almost freezes to death , and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another . he winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut , particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky style pummeling from one of the mad dog villains . it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness when i first saw this movie as a teenager , i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather , the ice ; at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise . lithgow's british accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter , but he's fundamentally a good actor , and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene , looking at his hostages stallone and rooker , trying to decide which tasks to give them , he actually says you , stay ! you , fetch ! even a better actor , such as anthony hopkins , might have had trouble with that line . even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside , it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show . early in the movie , for example , lithgow openly says to one of his men retire stallone when he comes down . no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face , and this precipitates a gripping tug of war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg . lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means , but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor . done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or at times a western , cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film . besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before , the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow , as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action packed narrative . finally , harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless , since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes . it's a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies , because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later . but perhaps it's best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time , without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already . there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit compared to that clinker , cliffhanger belongs on the imdb's top 250 list . rating 8 very good , especially considering most of stallone's other movies .",1,0

"no , this hilariously horrible 70's made for tv horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake . still , this exceptionally awful , yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute , unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so execrable it's downright awesome sort of way . richard crenna , looking haggard and possibly inebriated , and yvette mimieux , who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in jackson county jail , sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint , dull , sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit . pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann the psychic alien moppets from the disney witch mountain pictures are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty , ugly canine entity in the den . boy , now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing ? well , scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't , but it sure is funny , thanks to curtis night tide harrington's hopelessly weak direction , cartoonish not so special effects , an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot , and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story besides the leads , both martine beswicke and r . g . armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman . favorite scene the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna , practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade . while stuck up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock , devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo .",1,0
"ok , so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers , but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted , right ? right ! consider yourselves officially warned , and read on . in this parody tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history the 1980's a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious murder mcgee , who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard . as i'm sure you can guess , things go from bad to worse faster than you can say where's the beef ? and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody , the dialogue is cheesy , and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get . good times . no clique or 80's horror movie clich d characterizations are left unrepresented here . in fact , no stone was left unturned at all we have the cool hero , his innocent girlfriend , the goth chick , the tough thug think john bender , the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt , the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt , a couple of gorgeous half naked lesbians , and two big geeks . as you can plainly see , the cast is pretty big . usually , larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly , with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel . not in this case though . not a single cast member left me disappointed . the acting was very well done . everyone from the cool hero in his thriller jacket played by jovan meredith to the grooovy goth chick played by renee dorian to geeks one two played by cory assink jonathan brett they all played it straight , brought their a game , and knocked it out of the park . if you're a fan of gary wyatt in weird science , you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks . director co writer jeff c . smith is a guy to watch for in the future , trust me on this . if this is what he can do with a low budget , there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects . the characters were dead on ; the atmosphere was perfect ; the laughs were huge ; the blood flowed , and squirted , and sprayed beautifully it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980's . call this one the breakfast club meets night of the demons ! the tag line says it all , and says it honestly excessive violence ; gratuitous nudity ; zero budget no false advertising here , folks ! as fans of this genre , we have to look to the indies and support these hard working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales , lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered down pg 13 'horror' or pointless remakes like the hitcher . no , thank you no more of that for me . in closing , i honestly have to say that stupid teenagers must die ! is by far one of the best indie flicks i've gotten the pleasure of watching this year . it's a bloody good time , and holds up on repeat viewings . from the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe . even the closing love theme over the end credits which if that doesn't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid 80's power ballads by reo speedwagon over pronounced r's on every word starting with the letter 'r' then i'll eat my dvd right now . bottom line is , if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general , no more hesitation this flick deserves to be in your collection !",1,0
"these slasher pics are past their sell by date , but this one is good fun . the valentine cards themselves are witty , and well thought out . the film has one peach of a line . he's no angel . when he in fact is angel ! watching buffy reruns will never be the same ! the cast is a sizzling display of young talent , but the story does not give them enough real depth . denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters . sorry but no ! the direction is very good , managing to show very little actual gore , and relying on your imaginations implied threat . much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes . essentially , the main directorial plus , lies within the borrowing of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks . psycho's shower scene is tributed , along with halloween's masking . murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know ! light viewing , not very scary but a few good jump moments . if it was a choice between the hole and this though , choose the hole . slasher movies have had their day , and this is just another slasher . a very good slasher , but nothing groundbreaking !",1,0

"you'd be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie especially one entirely located inside a us prison see this to prove yourself wrong ! it was produced in the 80's after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to 100m budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind ! being mr harlin's first major production and the at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar cast . i still think most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard's screen appearances not mentioning the well overrated mr s bergman directorial efforts at least for all female viewers but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense . do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror puff , imo it's definitely worth it !",1,0

"dog bite dog isn't going to be for everyone , but i really enjoyed it . full of slapping , stabbing and shooting but don't worry the lead's a terrible shot , it can best be described as a violent romp through hong kong and cambodia . edison cheng plays pang , a cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister . despite being filthy from his journey , he's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant . if this sounds wildly implausible to you , you should probably avoid this film . it acted as my cue to suspend disbelief , and i had a lot more fun for it . chasing pang down is wai sam lee , a young , edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke . wai walks a fine line that has internal affairs investigating him , and his father , a legendary good cop , is in a coma following a drug deal that went south the implication is that wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings . there are a car crashes , lots of killings , and a strange and awkward love story on offer here , all played out in almost comic book style . i suspect the humour was deliberate nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd , though the over the top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members . there are at least three points where the film might have ended , and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing , or the deletion of one of the narrative threads the light hearted stuff worked well , so i would have left out the interactions with the three fathers . i'm inclined to give it a high pass , however , if only because of the ending i've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment . this is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous",1,0

"this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival . but unlike yes , by sally potter , which i had seen some days before , where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive , this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down , and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe . it was as if , all of a sudden , there was nothing left , all hope , all future had been taken away to a dead place . nina's life seemed to be dismal and locked , but then , one lovely day , there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams . there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion , just out of nothing , someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life . that person was toni , a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots , just like herself . but the film's title is ghosts , and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish , there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people , strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself , hiding away from all other people . fran oise , a french woman , is a victim of such ghosts . she once lost her child daughter in berlin , who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket , in just one moment of inattentiveness . now time has passed , and fran oise is back in berlin , still looking for the missing child . nina could be that child , after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity . and nina adopts that idea , after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion , she also longs for a mother . but in the end she is empty handed , toni has disappeared with a man , and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman . marie is dead , concludes fran oise's husband , and the statement could not be more disillusioning . nina is just a ni a , a girl without name , there is no hope for any divine fulfillment . there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives . therefore , in the end , we see nina all alone , about to walk along the road that has opened up before her , into a future that seems joyless and uncertain .",1,0

"i'm not a fan of this brand of comedy stereotyped characters over acting their way through a cops and robbers farce . but there are enough likable characters to sustain interest . michelle pfeiffer is adorable , but the person really carrying the film is dean stockwell , who steals every scene as the head mobster named tony , no less . stockwell's performance is the reason i'm writing this review and the only reason i'd recommend it , in fact . you'll be tickled by his screen time . he's plays the mob boss perfectly , with comedic touches in the right places , managing to avoid becoming an overbearing cliche . in fact , stockwell's a complete delight to watch a master of the 'double take , ' and a real 'looker' in those classy suits and fedoras . meesa says a good film to watch while folding laundry or eating leftovers .",1,0
"ugh , what an embarrassing episode last night ! it was either a failed script for abc afterschool special , or the product of an earnest rookie writer , just out of college , making an homage to that classic pc anti gun homily from 1974 , the gun . in fact hubby were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of the gun being melted down like in the movie ! no , i'm not some nra shill . it's just that when the producer of an intelligent nuanced series gets it in his head that i should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal cause , i'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2 by 4 . geez ! ok , the sociology lesson is over . the message has been delivered . the important episode has been aired . now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence .",1,0
"spoilers ? i wasn't sure what to think of the movie . not too much of a kids film . definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying . but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it . i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had . even less without the credits and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature . but alas , they torture him . right until the end of the movie . those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars . but i do recommend the movie . even for a sequel . 8 10 quality 9 10 entertainment 7 10 replayable 7 10",1,0
"tripping over . i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes , but having faith in the show , and abe forsythe's unquestionable talent , i continued to watch . i can safely say i'm now glad that i did . the story did develop quite well , and all the characters have a strong base , and most don't have any information missing . the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie . some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line . here's to hoping for another season !",1,0
"overall , a well done movie . there were the parts that made me wince , and there were the parts that i threw my hands up at , but i came away with something more than i gone in with . i think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition . without spoiling it , let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in ramayana , is way beyond what this movie stands for . the ramayana is an epic . not a 200 page book that puts down women in india . the movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive indian family . while the basic tenets of the unwritten laws of the family tradition seem to be that of conservative india , let me assure my reader that i having lived in delhi for 12 years found entire parts that just did not ring those bells . i mean some things and some actions are very true , but some other stuff is just way off the mark . especially today . delhi is complicated . india is complicated . the director tries to simplify both . and fails pretty miserably at that . why in english ? can you imagine a movie about american indians in english . or the french speaking in english . seriously jarring . even the servant spoke in fluent accented english albeit with a hint of colloquialisms in the language for believability . but the chemistry between the leads is palpable . if you like it hot , this is a movie for you . i think that is the biggest saving grace the development of a true real life love story . if this film was about radha and sita , then it would have got full marks from me . and in being about them , it could have made a subtle statement . but this movie goes out there to say this is what india is , and this is what indian society is like . and in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails . just take everything you see with a pinch of salt . the dark secrets of india are not being revealed . just two girls are falling in love . just like it happens everywhere else .",1,0
"the visual effectiveness of this film is unmatched by anything i've seen . and the work required to make achieve it must have been incredibly long and tedious you don't just stick kodak grainy film in your camera to get this look . don't watch this film to be entertained , watch it to be visually stimulated , watch it to be challenged and provoked in your thoughts on film and any other topic that comes to mind , religion will likely be one thought .",1,0
"so dark the night poses a tough challenge it's very hard to write about it in any detail without ruining it for those who haven't yet seen it . since it remains quite obscure , that includes just about everybody . the movie will strike those familiar with its director joseph h . lewis' better known titles in the noir cycle gun crazy , the big combo , even my name is julia ross , which in its brevity it resembles as an odd choice . for starters , the bucolic french countryside serves as its setting . steven geray , a middle aged detective with the sur t in paris , sets out for a vacation in the village of ste . margot or maybe margaux . quite unexpectedly , he finds himself falling in love with the inkeepers' daughter micheline cheirel , even though she's betrothed to a rough hewn local farmer . but the siren song of life in paris is hard to resist , so she agrees to marry him , despite the disparity in their ages , which inevitably becomes the talk of the town . but on the night of their engagement party , she fails to return to the inn . soon , a hunchback finds her body by the river . her jealous , jilted lover is the logical suspect , but he , too , is found dead . then anonymous notes threaten more deaths , which come to pass . for the first time in his career , the bereaved geray finds himself stumped . a particularly weak script all but does the movie in ; it plays like bad cornell woolrich crossed with the murder of roger ackroyd . but lewis does this creaky vehicle proud . he takes his time near the beginning , but then the story and the storytelling gain momentum alas , just about the time the script breaks an axle . burnett guffey lighted and photographed the film , with an intriguing leitmotif of peering out of and peeping into windows ; there's also an effective score by hugo friedhofer , who supplied aural menace to many noirs . a good deal of talent has been lavished on so dark the night , but at the end it boils down to not much more than a gimmick and not a very good gimmick at that . it's a one trick pony of a movie .",1,0
"aaah . the thing . to see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty , but distinctly unattractive , makes a refreshing change , and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters , rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover . and carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over styled parodies . and there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending , or cameo celebrity appearance , or lame pseudo romantic subplot . and i really miss on set physical effects ; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics . in the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw alien , the elephant man , poltergeist , the howling , an american werewolf in london , the thing , the company of wolves , a nightmare on elm street . what an era for horror effects ! and don't get me started on the death of matte painting . the matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless . what do we have now ? third rate cgi , former music video directors and professional stylists , that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy mtv videos . now i'm going to go netflix 'the howling' .",1,0
"this movie deserves the 10 i'm giving it . but it's not the 10 that you'd give to movies like 'the godfather' or 'goodfellas' or 'psycho' . this is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh , over and over again ! it's the most horribly written and directed movie , yet it doesn't fail to entertain . it has the most amateur effects , yet you enjoy every moment ! i saw this movie today on tv , and i didn't want to move away ! read the following dialogue to know why ! whole college is standing around manisha , who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness bad guy 1 please forgive us ! bad guy 2 yes , we won't do it again . no response from manisha akshay come on , forgive them ! manisha i don't know . akshay you are a beautiful woman , and even dead men can get aroused by you ! and these are living young males ! don't blame them ! pancholi yeah manisha . manisha to suniel what if they tried to rape your girlfriend ? suniel i'd break their hands , legs and kill them . but anyways , just forgive them . akshay yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty ! now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue ! this movie never fails to entertain , mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations ! the bad guy munish can do basically anything . he can blow a sandstorm from his mouth , or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again . every actor takes turns to speak . one line from akshay , then from suniel , then from arshad , then aftab , then nigam . it's the main rule followed by the director , so that equal screen time is given to each guy . and then there's the all powerful pendant , which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed ! all these things make it an enjoyable movie , and i can watch it over and over again . i think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one . the only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny .",1,0
"i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening . i gathered from the ads that it was a thriller . what we have is like compulsion meets matlock . two teens decide to commit a perfect murder . a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual murderers is found . then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander . innocent of the murder anyway enter sondra bullock as the investigating officer . imdb says that she's fbi , but i don't remember that . i thought that she was a regular cop she's frustrated by the inconsistency of the killers profile the profile doesn't fit the profile ! and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys . she's also has demons of her own which figure prominently in her decicision to become a cop . but this is the only character that is really more than one dimensional . all others are pretty flat . for a thriller , there are really no big thrills . it's mostly a cat and mouse game like an episode of matlock which she's watching at one point in the film . the twist is that there are two involved in the killing . just who is the real murderer , justin or richard ? it'll cost you eight bucks to find out .",1,0
"the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in . people come looking for a b grade horror film , or a so bad it's good movie . jack frost 2 is neither of these . it is , to put it simply , a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one . to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless scary movies combined is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level . it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions . the premise is simple ; the characters from the first movie , haunted by memories of jack frost , take a vacation to a tropical island . a new , improved jack comes after them , now with essentially the powers of hydro man from spider man ; essentially , he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly , divide himself , multiply himself , and , worst of all , he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness . antifreeze . what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost a simply horrible movie can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel . just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action , jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre . most of the entertainment comes the live action actors , who serve admirably . particularly funny among them are ray tooney playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s , christopher allport offering an insane , hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film , and david allen brooks taking the once serious role of manners to new , totally bizarre heights . the lack of memorable quotes disturbs me . as a horror movie , jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman , rates a zero . but you have to understand , it's not a horror movie .",1,0
"i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it . it actually exceeded my expectations . considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well made film . the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways , especially given the plot . just like the blair witch project , this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film . another bonus whereas most low budget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocre to unintentionally hysterical acting , this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters , particularly the two leads . the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline . it borrows heavily from better known films like deliverance and wrong turn but if you're like me , films of this nature never cease to be terrifying . plus , the director keeps things interesting throughout . i'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out .",1,0
"sunny , a cocktail waitress in the d . c . area , is a bit dim , to put in mildly . she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple . however , she saves the life of a prominent arab , by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official . she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks . sniffing an opportunity , presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the u . s . government . even then , she messes things up at times , but she tries hard and learns a lot . she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official . but , is there another sinister plot in the making , involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife ? a blonde one ? lol , lol , lol . this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb as a fox , as they say . sunny learns her way around the jungle of the u . s . government very , very well . she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings . perhaps , the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work , but for those who like to laugh , rent this today .",1,0
"i only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much . pornography has a useful purpose in society can't say i can always think of one but it probably does . personal viewpoints set aside , i really thought this film was pretty funny . i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography , i bought it because i am one of those 'alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'alice in wonderland' . i own just about every version there is on dvd so it was an obvious choice to complete my dvd collection with this . i must admit i was scandalized beyond my expectations , and the whole thing would have been thoroughly offensive if it hadn't been so damned funny . besides , the music is really good and i like musicals . not everyone can make a good nudie musical . anyone that has seen 'the first nudie musical' knows what a stink bomb that was . considering what a low budget bill osco worked with , 'alice' is pretty remarkable as a musical it's better than some musicals made on costly budgets . the film can't totally escape the dirtiness of porn . i usually watch the xxx version for full shock effect and some of those scenes are scandalizing scandalizing because we are talking about lewis carroll . i found myself feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where 'alice' kristine debell starts masturbating . it made me feel like a voyeur . and the gratuitous lesbian scenes with 'alice' and the kitty cats were a bit too racey . the film has a great sense of humor about everything however . there is one especially funny moment during the queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says who do i have to f k to get out of this movie ? . hilarious . i'm not sure i buy the whole sex is good for you ball your brains out philosophy here , but sex is human , and nothing human disgust me . i don't know if i really feel that way , but i couldn't resist saying it some people think everything should be about sex . i dunno . jeez , just show some frick'in responsibility and decorum . this movie definitely scores points for the sex minded , but i wouldn't push your luck , next time you might really freak someone out . i mean we are dealing with children's literature here .",1,0

"mad dog' earle is back , along with his sad sack moll marie , and that fickle clubfoot velma . so are babe and red , doc and big mac , and even the scenery chewing mutt pard . the only thing missing is a good reason for remaking raoul walsh's high sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame , and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original . instead of walsh we get stuart heisler , for humphrey bogart we get jack palance , for ida lupino shelley winters , and so on down through the credits . the only change is that , this time , instead of black and white , it's in warnercolor ; sadly , there are those who would count this an improvement . i died a thousand times may be unnecessary and inferior but at least it's not a travesty ; the story still works on its own stagy terms . earle palance , fresh out of the pen near chicago , drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin lon chaney , jr . knocking over a post mountain resort . en route , he almost collides with a family of oakies , when he's smitten with their granddaughter ; the smiting holds even when he discovers she's lame . arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up , he finds amateurish hotheads at one another's throats as well as winters , who throws herself at him as does the pooch . biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel , palance to winter's chagrin offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl's deformity , a gesture that backfires . then , the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath . on the lam , palance moves higher into the cold sierras . it's an absorbing enough story , competently executed , that lacks the distinctiveness walsh and his cast brought to it in 1941 , the year bogie , with this role and that of sam spade in the maltese falcon , became a star . and one last , heretical note those mountains do look gorgeous in color .",1,0

"this movie's origins are a mystery to me , as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it . i assume that before starship troopers , killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network , cable , or otherwise . the new title of kill shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence , the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema . the quick cuts , cheesy melrose place music , and short 2 second close up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for . and i don't mind at all . i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers an excellent book , in my opinion , not so hot a movie but that's another review . after looking it up on imdb , my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career see bond girl and wild things references here . they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r rated status coveted in suspense video rental sections , that is . in any event , they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense softcore porn section . all in all , it's entertaining . i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a tv pilot , though . that was the biggest pull while watching it when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show , the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual . would i rent it again ? no . would i watch this tv show ? well , why not it's better than baywatch . and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s . token black guy who's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter racial dating , token asian japanese , i assume from the name koji more adept at science and computers than talking to women , beautiful , intelligent latina pre med student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account this show probably would have done ok . but as a movie it just cracks me . i gave it a 7 out of 10 , considering what it was and what it was forced to become . it made for a very enjoyable evening , and that's all i ask of rentals .",1,0

"i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie . for instance , the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could hollywood just throw in a token gay character in the movie . and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great . one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top . and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters . for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible . but i guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad . but if you're more open minded and i don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film .",1,0
"jack frost 2 , is probably the most cheesiest movie i have ever seen in my life . the complete title of the film , is jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman . horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines , will be delighted to watch this . this film was straight to video , and for good reasons . here's why the acting , was so atrocious , and so terrible , that it could cause one to cry . the main character had no personality , and the actor's bad acting made it all worse . the screenplay was , was also atrocious . each character always says a cheesy line , and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography , then you have something bad . second , the story line isn't really all that impressive , but since this movie was straight to video , it is forgiven . the director , and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman , into something cool , but they didn't . they story has lots of plot holes in it . in the beginning , a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank , with the melted jack frost . scientists try to restore his life , but they couldn't . once the cup of coffee fell into the tank , jack frost was completely restored . now he is immune to anti freeze . in jack frost part 1 , the main character's dna got mixed up with the anti freeze that was used to kill jack frost . since the main character is allergic to bananas , jack frost is too . hence , here's my point . they say that sam's dna combined with jack frost's . but , one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup , so when it fell into the tank , the scientists dna would have been combined with jack frosts . another thing , the special effects weren't very good either . here's the good points jack frost 2 has lots of blood , that looks pretty realistic . even though this movie is flawed to hell , it is still entertaining . overall , jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie . the first one was better though . 7 out of 10 .",1,0

"presenting lily mars mgm , 1943 is a cute film , but in my opinion it could have been better . judy garland is great as always , but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van heflin develops all too quickly . i mean , one minute he's ready to beat her butt , but the next minute he falls in love with her . i believe that this production , the film editing , and the script even though the photography was great , the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well could have been a little better . it feels as though the production was too rushed . the supporting cast was good as well , especially little janet chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter rosie . she at the age of 11 , looks really cute and it's a shame that she didn't develop into a teenage comic actress . she's much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late 1930's except for broadway musketeers 1938 , she's really good in that , when they tried to make her into a shirley temple sybil jason hybrid . overall , this film could better , but in the end , judy gave it her all .",1,0
"chokher bali was shown at the washington dc filmfest april 15 , 2005 . the director , rituparno ghosh , was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards . as always , i think aishwarya did a fantastic job . i can understand those who think she should be been more aggressive or more bitchy , but would that really be realistic in 1904 ? possible , maybe ; realistic , i'm not so sure . i think her interpretation was valid , although there could certainly be other ways to do it . i hate to use the word , but this was the most inaccessible of the indian movies i have seen so far . i know a fair amount of indian history , hindu religion , etc . , but the level of detail here was far beyond me . clearly you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were intimately familiar with hinduism and its customs , esp . as they were c . 1904 . i missed a lot of things one of them being the fact that the mother in law would want binodini in the house as sort of a counter weight to her daughter in law ashalata . spoilers ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie much better for me . first , the original bengali version was 20 minutes longer . so what was left out ? apparently three main things a beginning segment where binodini aishwarya leaves e . bengal for calcutta . according to the director , different characters are speaking w . bengali vs . e . bengali setting up some of the political comments later . of course all of this is lost in the hindi version , and certainly to a non indian like me , it wouldn't have mattered anyway but a set up of the bengali situation sure would have . next , there was a segment where binodini was writing a poem a sign of her independence , etc . finally , some more business about the jewellery . so , although some people think it was too long , i think the original , longer version would have been clearer . the women's hair was apparently another sign ghosh again the mother in law had short hair short hair for hindu widows , her sister also a widow had longer hair more modern ! , and of course binodini aishwarya had extremely long waist length hair rejection of status of widowhood . the ending really threw me all of a sudden binodini , who had never had a political thought , is writing a political manifesto ? whoa ! ghosh explained that he was in locarno , at a film festival , when the subtitles were done . the subtitles use the word country throughout binodini's letter . gosh said a more appropriate word would have been i forget his exact word something like self or independence she was talking about her own liberation and finding herself not about bengal , india , and the british . so why does binodini just disappear the day after finding behari again ? apparently because during her stay on the ganges she realizes that she doesn't need a man any man to define complete her . she can just be herself . so she rejects behari , who she threw herself at a few months ? before , and just goes off . of course i'm not sure how she buys her next meal , but that's another question . the red shawl ghosh again she buys represents revolution as well as passion . i'm not 100 sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman , but perhaps she is rejecting passion revolution ? the binoculars , which binodini uses throughout the movie to watch mahendra and ashalata , the boat on the ganges , etc . . she is being a voyeur to see a life she yearns for but can't have . at the end i missed this ! she leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter , showing that she doesn't need them any more she's going off to lead her own life . finally , the tagore quote at the beginning saying how he apologized for the ending . apparently tagore wrote this as a serial , hooking his readers with the sexy widow bits . but at the end he sold out to conservatism and had binodini kneel down at the feet of mahendra and behari , begging their forgiveness . one of his students ? wrote to tagore taking him to task for his sell out ending . and tagore replied with his apology for the ending . in the movie , of course , ghosh goes in the other direction .",1,0
"okay . yes , this was a very tight budget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together , and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt out part , and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles . but come on . richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip . steven ford was very likable . mancuso had some great lines , while nancy allen , ironically , was completely bland and uninteresting . classic ? no . bad parts ? yes . entertaining ? big yes . i would have loved to have been on set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have . are you fast ? . y'ain't that fast .",1,0

"nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie flicks , but honestly why would we bother ? every single film in the zombi series delivers great fun , nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and zombi 3 is no exception to this , despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting . this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project , who had to elaborate further on his zombi 2 success , but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films . the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity , every ingenious idea from george a . romero's night of the living dead and the crazies is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at . yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over the top gore compensates for everything ! on a secret army base at the phillipines , scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus death one and prepare it for transport . after a failing attempt to steal the virus , the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village . the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area . this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's nightmare city . truly bad . but incredibly entertaining with fast paced action sequences and several very creative zombie madness situations . the undead birds were original , for example , and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well . the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick . recommended to the fans ; don't mind the negative reviews .",1,0

"i watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it . i loved it . a very good , tight plot , an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly , fat , deaf girl and the ex con , and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried . a much , much better film than the same director's de battre mon coeur s'est arret , which was boring and unbelievable . the only thing that didn't quite work was that the supposedly ugly , fat girl was neither ugly nor fat solid , certainly , and far from conventionally beautiful , but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it . superb . i wish she was in more films , and better ones than she generally is . i've seen a bit of gilles' wife and a bit of the moustache , and they both looked like rubbish , and i've seen all of de battre mon coeur s'est arret , and that certainly is rubbish . she seems to have a few coming up , so i'll keep my fingers crossed .",1,0

"first , nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly . not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ghost trains as a child . second , the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future . third , this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes , eva mendezes , and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb lights are . mrs . christian is not a light , but a sun . however , dark remains is also of considerable metaphysical importance . they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and imagination that are not visible with one' own eyes is not new . but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times . this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign , but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the real reality can . being a sign , the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects , i . e . the sign behaves like an object . now , in our usual world of perception , it is common that objects change signs . f . ex . , if someone grows a bird , his photograph will show him with beard , not without , as it did before . but the opposite , the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man . this is , very simply expressed , the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison , in this movie . this is new , and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well known , mostly since the silent time .",1,0
"as far as i know , this show was never repeated on uk television after its original run in the late '60s early '70s , and most episodes are now sadly missing presumed wiped . series 6 from 1971 however still exists in its entirety , and i recently got the chance to watch it all , the best part of 4 decades on . after rushing home from school , freewheelers was essential viewing for me and many of my contemporaries back in those halcyon days of flared trousers , slade and chicory tip . and watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat . never mind the bad hammy acting , the unintentionally amusing fight scenes , plot holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean going yacht through and the frightfully , frightfully rada accents of the lead players . no forget all that . because freewheelers harks back to a bygone dare i say golden age of kids' tv drama , when the shows were simply about rip roaring fun and didn't take themselves so seriously . before they became obsessed with all the angst laden ishoos that today's screenwriters have their young protagonists fret over , such as relationships , pregnancy , drugs , stis etc . no doubt if it were remade for a modern audience in these days of all pervasive political correctness , the boss figure would be a black female , one of the young male heroes would be a muslim , the other would be a white lad confused about his sexuality and the girl would be an all action go getter with an iq off the scale , who'd be forever getting the lads out of scrapes and making them look foolish in other words a million miles removed from wendy padbury's deferential , ankle spraining washer upper . it's a show that's very much of its time . but is that a bad thing ? i for one don't think so .",1,0

"the 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun . sometimes , there were some definite brains behind it all evil dead ii , night of the creeps and return of the living dead for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends . movies like pieces and blood diner stacked rental shelves in the 80's and 90's , offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment . kevin tenney's 1988 movie night of the demons is a part of this tradition stupid , poorly acted and not an original bone in it's body , but dammit if you don't have a good time . the plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80's a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20's decide to go to a party at hull house thrown by angela mimi kinkade and suzanne scream queen legend linnea quigley . well , angela and co . decide to throw a s ance . this turns out to be as will arnett's arrested development character gob would call it , a huge mistake , because a demonic force soon possesses angela , and starts to get to the others as well . take the evil dead , a nightmare on elm street and your average dumb dead teen flick , throw them in a blender , and night of the demons is what you get . the movie is anything but original , and really , it's not a good movie . the whole thing is insanely derivative , the acting is terrible , the jokes often fall flat , the characters are annoying especially the character of stooge and the plot holes are numerous . that out of the way , it's still a lot of fun . so why ? well for one thing , the make up and gore effects are top notch , with some really memorable moments especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick that really stick out . it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously , yet with the exception of some terrible puns , plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness . plus , there's a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that's almost impossible to resist . yeah , it's nothing special , but it knows that , and it couldn't be more proud of that fact . it's a goofy party horror movie , and it never pretends to be anything more . it might not be a classic , but night of the demons is a good example of horror junk food done right . it might not be too memorable or original , but sometimes you don't want a fancy beer . sometimes you want a budweiser .",1,0

"spoilers ahead it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be such a disappointment . i thought this was full of silly clich s and that it basically tried to hard . to the american guys out there how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds ? to the married girls how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight but not with your husband ? to the french would you really ask about someone being la fac when you know they don't speak french ? wouldn't you use a more common word like universit ? i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understand europe and i love it , but my german roommate and i found this pretty insulting overall . it looked like a movie funded by the european parliament , and it tried too hard basically . it had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together not a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward , but in fact ridiculous too many clashes that wouldn't really happen . then the end of the movie the last 10 minutes ruined all the rest . why doesn't xavier talk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris ? why does he just walk off ? why does he just run away from his job , is that freedom ? and in the end , is the new europe supposed to rest on a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day ? is this what it's made up of ? besides , the acting was pretty horrible . i can't believe judith godr che's role and acting . why was she made to look like emanuelle b art so much ? at first i thought xavier was ok but with retrospect i think he was pretty bad . and that's all really too bad , because technically opening credits , scenes when he's asking what papers he needs it was really good except for sound editing around the british siblings , and the soundtrack was great too . so the form was good , but the content pretty horrible .",1,0

"this film is amazing and i would recommend to child and adult alike . the animation is beautiful , the characters are rich and interesting , and the story is captivating ; far better than anything the american studios were producing at the time . however , there is a couple of caveats to this statement . it's a shame that disney bought the studio ghibli back catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it . my main point being , disney re dubbed the film , despite the original english version being very impressive . the new cast with van der beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e . g . pazu and sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers . the original music score is also far better than the disney remix . it begs the question why did disney make such changes ? it seems to me is that by having van der beek et al being cast then disney can draw in more money , which is fair enough , but in the process they tainted they film . it is still a beautiful film and i would still recommend it to anyone . my main beef is that disney ruined a film from childhood which i loved and still love . i am lucky enough to have an original japanese import with the original english dub which i am now going to guard with my life !",1,0

"the history of tv to film adaptations are littered with aberrations which almost conclusively prove that the tradition should never have started in the first place . there are , however , some examples which manage to pull it off , just . rising damp would , at first , appear to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment as this hilarious series was based within the tiny confines of a northern bedsit . also the writer , eric chappell , wasn't being paid enough to spend time crafting an entirely original screenplay so he harvested a batch of tv episodes and stitched them together to form the body of the film . this , in itself , didn't necessarily mean that the script would fail . david croft and jimmy perry did the same thing with their screenplay for dad's army and it worked superbly . although , the early dad's army episodes , with their staid pace and over arcing plot , lent themselves far better to film adaptation . the rising damp episodes , however , were high energy affairs from the first scene to the breathless climax . as a result , as one story is concluded and another started , the scenes within the film become disjointed . another pitfall for the movie version of a tv series is the inevitable comparisons that are made . in this respect the film pales in comparison to rising damp's brilliant series . despite all this , rising damp the movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally uproarious . it is perhaps not surprising that the finest moments occur during sequences written specially for the film . this includes a rugby match where rossiter does a brilliantly timed pratfall . indeed , while all the cast handle their roles perfectly bar a sub standard replacement actor for the late and truly great beckinsale , it is leonard rossiter as rigsby that shines the most . in fact rising damp should have been made as a film just so rossiter could have been eligible for an oscar , such is the magnificence of his acting talent . criminally , he wasn't even nominated . ultimately , the film fails to match the giddy heights of the tv series while managing to hold its own as a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments . recommended viewing . one last thing the opening and closing music is by far the worst in film history .",1,0

"spoilers spoilers spoilers just a few small ones saw this on satilite channel , missed the first 30 min of movie , will keep this comment short and informative . the movie is basically about 5 characters , the acting is very bad for afew characters . 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it backfires and the 3 kidnap the 2 . this is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical , mysterious and . you get the point ; but do to their own , personal , lack in thinking they fall terribly short . like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd looks the part but his tongue can't speak it . the writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly unknowingly i believe that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it . i wish i could give an example but i cant recall any exactly as it was said . the ending was bad as well . but the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady , although she , as well as the rest , had a lot of clich s . so why would i give this movie a 7 stars if i thought all the above ? simple , i give the entire seven stars to lisa keller one sexy a momma . she is fine lol . i am an appreciator of beauty , and she is exactly that . but don't get me confused because i'm not a pervert and this movie is not a porno in any way . their is somethin about her i cant explain , but i like it . i remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out , bumps into keller . she tries to get way but she doesn't have a chance . he throws her down , kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down , no panties ; . now , although she has an amazing ass and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think it was her facial expression that got me . she wanted it , and that look had me thinking i was behind that . i would have torn that booty up ! after that expression , i jus couldn't look at her objectively anymore , i was in love . lol . i am glad to have seen this movie but if lisa keller wasn't playing the lead role , i would have changed the channel . well . after i had seen the scene i mentioned above . i am a lisa keller fan know , but is seems that she isn't a consistent actor , seeing this 2003 movie is her latest . but i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it .",1,0

"i saw two movies over the weekend , one was kaal and the other waqt . both movies are made in bollywood but they are worlds apart . the fundamental difference is the story and the director . vipul shaw made his indelible mark with ankhen , one of the best comedy hindi movies . his casting of the charecteres is perfect . the story apparently taken from a gujerati play is awesome , the treatment is superb with some exceptions . in bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a bollywood director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy mediocre malik in this instance is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract . so even a good director like vipul shah has to use them to appease the finacier and the grandma's who just cant get enough of these numbers . no music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie . none of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the bharat natyam . the duelling and role playing the father and son is good acting by bachachan and akshay kumar . his stunt scenes are clearly outstanding . a good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie . then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer like sharukh khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like kaal to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of art , and they surround themselves with borderline talent , and they recoup the investment before the word gets around . these are the bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner film farce awards given by bollywood chamcha's and most of them are in the media .",1,0

"i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago . i enjoyed the film at that time , so i was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since . perhaps it's my memory , but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival . i'm really not sure which version i prefer , but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both . let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie . although it's been promoted as a hammer films tribute , people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed . there's some cleavage , but no nudity a staple of the british production house's later movies . and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film , and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt , it's not like any of the company's pictures in tone or execution . this film is very dark , very confusing , and at times very funny . i don't remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one , but that's not a bad thing especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short . and some of ms pitt's rantings are quite entertaining . it's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose . the uniqueness of this film doesn't lie with the borrowed details , though . it's in the ideas . as an occasional sci fi channel viewer , i've regularly taken the network to task for its one note variations on a theme cgi monster kills , then gets destroyed . sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while . but don't get me wrong . i'm not complaining . if anything , i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising low budget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts . it's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are . but for the rest of us , those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films , the predictability , the lack of respect for the audience , this may just be your ticket .",1,0

"take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail . they're not the faces of hollywood extras . somebody in production was really smart to take filming to oxford , mississippi , because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot . scope out the narrow dusty roads , the frozen earth beneath , and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on . no wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving ; they're just reflecting the soil from which they spring . old man lucas hernandez better fear for his life , but then he springs from that same hard earth . the movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes and even has some suspense . old man lucas is not very likable . he's a victim and we sympathize , but he's also haughty and unfriendly . wisely , the script refuses to sweeten him up . that way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic . the script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective . instead , we're shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death . so , it's through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed , a much more effective pathway . it also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the jim crow system . note how the movie doesn't attack segregation . it's doubtful that old man lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there's no hint that even lawyer stevens brian wants to cross the color line except to see justice done . no , the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid jarman whose head is not yet filled with notions . he's not exactly friends with lucas , but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek . the last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle , the lawyer , instead of his more hidebound parents the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked . the lawyer might not join a future civil rights march , but the kid might . that's the movie's realistically hopeful side . there was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief 3 year period , 1949 51 , the well , no way out , home of the brave , lost boundaries . even famously detached mgm got into the mix with this little gem . unfortunately , the mccarthy purges in hollywood put an end to problem films that might not serve cold war ends . even so , each of these is worth catching up with , not only because they're good movies , but because even with the passage of 60 years and jim crow , they're still relevant .",1,0
"the costumes and make up were grand , there were some exceptionally funny lines , and the role was made for jim carrey . carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing . sure this was mostly a movie for kids , but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of dr seuss . i expected more from ron howard . it's worth a see , but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic , by any measure .",1,0
"existenz combines director david cronenberg's traditional love of blood and gore and exploding heads with the more confusing aspects of a reality twisting david lynch film . and it actually works effectively . i won't bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it'll only cause more confusion . all you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality . the film almost seems to abandon its technology fearing point at the end , but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue . there's also some very gross sexual imagery based around the 'bio ports' in the protagonists backs , as well as some very gross acting from jude law . he manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of . jason jennifer leigh comes off much better , and everyone else can be called a supporting character , including willem dafoe in a functional , if unspectacular , role as a money crazed mechanic . overall , existenz is a very effective sci fi film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive .",1,0

"i had a personal interest in this movie . when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union . at the end of my first day sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc . for one or two weeks . when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego . just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn . once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton , the big marine base . there , on the beach , we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base . it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation , which included a water tank , gun entrenchments , sand bagged trenches and living quarters . all this was at very high pay , sometimes 'golden time' , which was triple our regular hourly wage . our food was also first rate prime rib at lunch , etc . which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home . once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out , which was about eight or ten months later . then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen . then it was no more than three or four minutes maybe less of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens . a bit disappointing , but still fun . in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since . i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis , which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there . bob weverka",1,0

"beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature . forbidden lie 2007 is simply a better cinematic version of norma khouri's book forbidden love , and that was a best seller . an onion peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman , lie is the very best in editorialised reality tv . cleverly edited and colourful , broinowski's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of norma khouri meaningfully blowing smoke . i disagree with variety that it's overlong ; instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others' just recorded testimonials . on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired . so i watched it twice . this oscar worthy effort is at once genuinely funny , upsetting , and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another . the apparent con unfolded in the australian state of queensland via very personal swindles of khouri's friends and fans ! . clearly these friends are now turned , the funniest on camera line belonging to khouri's qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat , no nonsense colloquialisms i think it's a load of sh ! t . personally . we need to learn from their experience , hence my belief in spoilers . any perennial lie spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie . there's some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian , who instead presses her con artist repeatedly for corroboration . since being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication , khouri has been on the run , but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name . she absconded supposedly because a she's either terrified of her sly , more italian sounding than greek husband , or b because she needed her passport visas to clear her name . unlikely . a more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas one guess no , not jordan . according to a closing card , khouri is still under investigation by the fbi in 2007 . i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge . instead , the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen . once they caught on , there was plenty counter derision and catcalls ; earlier , stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didn't know how to take khouri's evolving contradictions . the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end , not leaving anything out not even her own self sacrifice . anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself . the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first key to how a lifelong liar operates in half truths . khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr old with rather disarming charm , and surprisingly , worked out biceps . gradually we're introduced to less and less adulating aussie journos , publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouri's honour killing accusations hook , line and sinker . later we see their more rueful reactions , quite self controlled and matter of fact , if some perhaps a little bitter . it was jordanian anti honour killing activists who took deepest umbrage at khouri's fallacies because its pot stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change . honour killings do happen in jordan ; it's just their prevalence that's at odds with khouri's book plus 72 other facts . in 2003 these activists faxed australian random house with 73 painstakingly checked objections . the publishing houses across 4 continents who'd jumped at the chance to publish first time author khouri never tried to check any facts . leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract , they too were fair game . so a massive hot topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafes . later still we're shocked to discover that the factual errors extend to khouri's bio as well . for one thing , she's not only not a 35yr old virgin her defence is that she merely didn't disabuse people of their assumptions , but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers ! sometimes she's just too fast talking in her american accent . she also seems too comfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes . i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who don't need any western paternalism from me , but when even cultural cues don't jibe in addition to khouri's facts , you've got to start questioning your source . at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion . she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account , in person , in jordan . the last third is consumed with a fact finding trip back to amman , where one fact after another falls . eventually broinowski forces her con artist to admit the decade discrepancy in her story , and it's after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera . secret , because in it khouri's american security guard jeremy is heard to have an australian accent he's an actor !

"i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it . what's great about it is the atmosphere , the music , the location , the cinematography and the beautiful cast . the story is non existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter . the pace in languid and the settings are exotic . the film has a lot going for it . unfortunately , it also has a few things going against it . the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever . because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability . according to imdb , al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie . they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen . the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous . there's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i've ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross dresser ! the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend ! and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter , in mid air . and al cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera ! i kid you not . ridiculous . we later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola . while the footage rolls , al and annie start making out . this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much . watching the footage of the cross dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud . is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way ? the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag , certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman , while piloting a helicopter , no less . al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene . i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly . speaking of drag , another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his two wives . a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting . the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex . in fact , orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film , even when he's with annie belle . this is another minor complaint about laure there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era . it just needed more skin to punch it up . except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments , laure is actually very watchable . i love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere , not the crude stuff we see today . p . s . make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt , which stars annie al but also another famous screen couple , laura gemser and gabriele tinti . the music in that movie is also great .",1,0
"this is another case of hollywood arrogance presuming to eclipse french style . the original , mon pere ce heros , was one of the most charming films of 1991 so naturally the accountants in hollywood thought they could hire depardieu and phone the rest in . they did , however , take the precaution of hiring francis veber to write an english version albeit one utilising virtually every word of the original . depardieu brings his gallic charm and katherine heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off . the thing is that when the french make a sort of lolita lite they get away with it because the 'dirty french postcard' thinking works in their favour ; here the hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have depardieu totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover , prevailed upon to play and song 'something french' , launch into a spirited version of thank heaven for little girls . see the original .",1,0

"it's a soap opera drawing upon an applied ethics idea . a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie . i didn't get any emotion from it , the ideas are not at all new , the tension lacks , it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way . i mean you have this middle aged , paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than don juan . he doesn't seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years , he has no issues with god and one would probably expect that too , the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves i can't get out of my mind bergman's cries and whispers , similar to this one in many respects , which simply bursts with emotions , and not all of them humane etc . this movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but don't expect to be blown away . the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer . amenabar doesn't rub your face in it and he doesn't take sides , he doesn't want to make us fanatics for a particular idea . still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded .",1,0

"i haven't read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on , but who knows , maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health . it isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health , but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie . you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i've read on one hand , but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire , i get the feeling that she writes really good novels . the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history . still , stuart townsend's voice over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt's vampire narrative ever did , and you can tell that queen of the damned's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline . while interview decided to go with lace and elegance , queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously . one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places . the costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack . however , i'll give credit where credit is due . the soundtrack is excellent . korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead . the film opens with a very cool goth rock zoom splice montage , but after the first ten minutes or so , the directing degenerates quickly . it's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice . what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects . unfortunately , queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress . where are the yellow contacts ? where's the pale blue make up ? scene after scene , i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem's lot and fright night when low budget was done right . there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage . props to aaliyah , and may her soul forever rest in peace . she might have become a renowned actress , had her life not been taken from us so prematurely , for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing . did i mention that the soundtrack was good ? let's see , what else can i say ? it wasn't too long . the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it . there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot . but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second rate vampire movies out there . the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything . jy jimboduck dot com",1,0

this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan which was aired at least 15 years ago . the series was known as gubbarre meaning balloons . each episode was a new short story . the story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and convincing abhay doel does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a normal and third class guys as he calls himself in the movie . in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the abhays role but shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off . i would suggest watching the series if it is available . it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction . the acting of the tv actors was much better than these stars . the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour or 45 minutes story to 2 hours . so it has to get draggy . even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up . this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original tv serial . the script and the ending of the serial was much better spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him . he is aware and tell her that he doesn't want to be repayed and never helped with that intention . the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film . the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement . the deliver just wasn't right . but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy . no credit should be given to the director scriptwriter . the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of premchand munshi . i am not sure if this is premchand munshi's story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi's and other great hindi writers stories .,1,0

"style over substance . but what a style it is . the cell is the internal version of most serial killer movies . unfortunately , the story hardly supports the visuals . psychotherapist catherine deane j lo goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions . a new patient whose fallen into a coma , is brought to her attention by the fbi . he's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins . deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim . director tarsem singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production . each dream sequence is like a nightmare ish painting in motion , from the landscapes to the costumes . but the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters . stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about . without him , you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only , which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary . lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway , though she's as gorgeous as ever . and vince vaughn ? i don't even know why he was chosen . this is not his forte and he overacts to boot . he tried too hard to become his character and it showed . stick to comedy , vince ! even so , this movie is so visually frightening , i still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward .",1,0
"this is best showing of what i think jesus really was like . most movies show jesus as being effeminate , lobotomized , or tortured . this jesus laughed , played , and was serious when it was necessary . this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to , not the usually hollywood version . the movie took some liberties , attempting to fill in the blanks . but the fillers didn't seem impossible , or even improbable . one thing i might argue , was that it never really explained what the romans had against jesus movie portrayed that the romans were the main driver of jesus' death , not that the jewish authorities were against the idea . it seemed that the movie was researched well . one example was the offhand comment to a teenage boy who was called mark . it is believed that mark or john mark was the boy referred to at the garden of gethsemane whose cloak was pulled off and ran away naked mark 14 51 . i get the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate even in spirit was much as possible .",1,0
"progeny is about a husband and wife who experience time loss while making love . completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they try to go on with their lives . the hubby begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist . he comes to believe that aliens are responsible for this lapse in time and that the unborn baby he once thought was his and his wife's actually belongs to the aliens . if ya ask me , this is a great scifi horror story . taking a highly questionable real life scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definite thumbs up from this guy . i love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas . so if you also share an interest in things extraterrestrial , you should be pretty happy with progeny . at least story wise anyways . unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average . with average acting by all actors . yep , even by the consistently awesome mr . dourif , who still does deliver the best performance . though the black head doctor , delivers his lines really well . there are a few points in the flick where some of the delivery is cringe or laugh worthy , which is fine in my book . i like them cheesy and this had a little bit of some nice stinky cheese , and i mean that in a good way . anyways , with a less than stellar script you can't really blame all the actors . i especially didn't care for the mother hysteria the film went for . she wanted a baby so badly that she'd neglect and dismiss everything her loving husband who's a doctor ! said to her . it almost reached a point where you actually didn't care what happened to her . the progeny is another flick by brian yuzna from the icky sticky film , society . again he delivers some slimy effects , and again he delivers a pretty unique tale of horror . if you're into scifi horror or are a fan of dourif and or yuzna films , there's no real reason not to check out this flick if you get the chance . a generous 7 outta 10 .",1,0
"i thought how the grinch stole christmas was a pretty good movie . it wasn't horrible , nor was it great , but it was enjoyable to watch . i felt as if jim carrey got a little annoying at times . they made the grinch seem like a special education person , when all he needed to be was evil and devious , but yet he turned out kind of retarded . i did think the scenery , when not inside the grinch's cave , was beautiful , and there was a few parts where i laughed , but most of the time i thought it was just annoying . this movie could've been so much better if they had changed the grinch's personality , and they had included some more laugh scenes , because most of the humor wasn't funny . i liked how the grinch stole christmas anyway , but it's not anything to get excited about seeing .",1,0
"i can't say how closely the film follows the novel , never having read the book , but since this clocks in at some six and a half hours it's a good bet that most of the base are covered or , at least , we can say with some certainty that this isn't a reader's digest condensed version . the production values are high , well up to the standards of other bbc classic series like inspector morse and sherlock holmes . we can believe dickens' london looked , sounded , and thought a lot like this . there are some occasional minor lapses some sportsman firing a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever this took place . the acting too is to be applauded . suzanne burden is the polite and honest heroine who quietly goes about doing good . she's cute too , in a mature way , her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any flirtatiousness . denholm elliott is her guardian and more than that , as it turns out . burden and elliott are two of the very few characters who are good in an unalloyed way . another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people . another is a poor and helpless young boy . i don't think anyone else could have written this . it's got all the earmarks of dickens poverty , tragic deaths , capitalism in the raw , the generous rich guy in his gated home , hidden parentage , shadowy motives , and the impotence or outright maliciousness of the justice system . well , not the justice system as a whole but the chancery , which was evidently a court that decided matters having to do with the distribution of property . so i gather from wikipedia . it became so notoriously rigid and dilatory that it was thoroughly revamped in england in 1973 . twice , elliott's character describes it as a curse . the most impressive scene involves a money scrounging creditor hounding a retired soldier in the latter's gymnasium during a fencing lesson . the sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character i remember from dickens . the apoplectic money lender and renter is screaming threats from his seat and the sergeant turns towards him and does one delicate exercise with the saber after another , each advancement bringing him closer to his tormentor , while the scarlet faced old creditor shrinks back into his seat . a couple of things are missing . often dickens will stick in at least one or two amusing lines of dialog . humbug ! or the law is a ass . not here . bleak house is the right title . second , there are practically no weberian ideal types no mr . micawbers or artful dodgers or scrooges . third , the atmosphere , the whole ethos , is relentlessly dismal . one tribulation follows another , usually having to do with money or some shameful peccadillo out of the past . my god , it's depressing . it's as if the author were venting his spleen on everything he hated in the world he knew . poverty , okay . he knew poverty . but one wonders what the chancery did to dickens to deserve this kind of treatment . maybe i should add that i've just watched the first episode of the 2005 series and it's better in two ways . there is more zip in the direction , so the pace is a little faster . and the business of jarndyce vs . jarndyce is explained satisfactorily right up front , instead of lurking about in the shadows as that mysterious curse , so the plot is easier to follow .",1,0
"the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is beauty . beauty is all around , in actors' play andie is superb as always , in well designed shots , and in authors' red line idea the love . i think the kenny's character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life . his interaction makes andie's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be . when he's gone , it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires . the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad , instead it shows that life prevails in any forms , even in this small british village , which is shown perfectly . another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways all that houses and fags and accents . and andie again is doing superb job ! it is a shame that this movie got such low marks . 10 out of ten !",1,0
"after attack of the fifty foot woman with alison hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men , there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than dorothy provine from it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world to play the role . the downsize is that cute and blonde provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into allison hayes' size 50 shoes . this role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal ; provine is more the girl next door type . she may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy , but the material lets her down . lou costello , however , proves he can do a movie without bud abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to gale gordon as his front man for gags . gordon , however , establishes that all he can be is blustery , perturbed and pushy , much the same character he creates later on the lucy show . charles lane also plays the same role in everything he does a straight man , and his screen time is limited . the special effects are convincing for the time , but i would have liked dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous . as the movie's lead character , she takes second billing to costello who is in all of the movie with dorothy several times vanishing like a sub plot . the whole movie put together just can't decide if it's supposed to be science fiction , a comedy or just a parody of the allison hayes classic . there's a lot of good scenes , some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film . still , i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women ; there's not enough movies out there like this one . if this movie had a chance to be remade today , i'd highly recommend courtney cox and jason alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely re write the original script . courtney tops my lists of actresses who i believe could and should adequately play gorgeous giantesses ; although , i have to admit that if either of the titanic beauties allison or dorothy came after me , i'd go quietly !",1,0

"forget neo and bourne and all those half baked made up modern heroes . they only look 12 year oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes . since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones , hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick . however , their action set pieces are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question . this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years . for better rocky , rambo or worse die hard 4 where john mcclane , brace yourselves . had no beard ! i say it is high time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end . this largo winch movie is far from perfect , and perhaps too predictable at times , but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action hero . and the only one time where he was weakened is when m lanie thierry shaved his beard ! i rest my case . i didn't know it when i entered the theater room , but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade . for the first time in france since belmondo , can a movie be both well crafted and rooted in b genre without blushing over its performance . in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience . in other words it was le pacte des loups or dobermann i like dobermann , mind you . i believe largo winch has what it takes to be both popular and quality film making . i exited the theater room very pleased , and hungry for more .",1,0

"sister helen is a superb documentary about a rigid , intolerant , foul mouthed , bitter , oblate civilian nun who runs a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very rundown neighborhood in the south bronx . all but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunks addicts . robert , the only middle class representative he had a real job , house , and even a bmw regrets she died before he could tell her off . why ? robert , like six of the residents , was on parole . he complained that helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didn't cow tow to her . in an extras interview he said helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life her husband and her two boys . the husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55 . one boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15 . helen was left with one daughter , who she abandoned to run the center . the daughter was not pleased . she wanted her mom what's fascinating is how little helen changed . outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change . but after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times once with the directors narrating it became clear that helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males . helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars . but her bossiness , intolerance , and sharp tongue didn't emerge at age 56 . living with her must have been extremely difficult . even robert says he stayed clean in spite of helen . the film opens with helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter . supposedly she is showing off her street savvy . another time she publicly demeans mel , her assistant for not bathing for a year . then she waves his filthy pillowcase in the air . the film is viscous with helen threatening and demeaning people . her signature song is my way . her favorite phrase is , i'm going to be totally honest with you . often , people who use such phrases , turn out o be the opposite . the residents are really down and out . only robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom . they all desperately need a roof over their heads , and helen , since she runs the place on her own , has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases . she has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding . it is her show . helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety . she stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too . she blames substance abuse on the drug or booze , and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug . she's no therapist , just a landlady who dyes her hair , wears a habit , and wields complete power over her tenants , and stopped drinking . helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine ureen she calls it tests on requests . twice major , a very solid and respected long term older resident who she trusted failed his tests . helen was furious and evicted him . major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin . helen didn't yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made . this was especially troubling since she knew major for a long time . yet she discounted her relationship with him , assumed he was a liar , and relied completely on the results . major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate . helen never apologized publicly , but supposedly made up with major privately . helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood . she tacitly admitted to robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someone's tires . the person wronged her and certainly deserved to have his her tires slashed . she was not a nice woman . so eventually , she decided the only way to keep the travis name her last name alive since the three male travises died was to start the travis center . for some of the residents it was a great deal . they complied with helen and in exchange received a cheap , safe , sober , and structured place to live . one however , said he preferred jail . addicts and drunks don't all need to be treated like children . helen employed old school techniques which have been discredited . however , no one was forced to remain at the center and for some , it was definitely a positive experience . the travis center is not a treatment center . it is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who what to straighten out their lives . to receive the full sister helen experience , see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with sister helen and her guests .",1,0

"okay , sure , this movie is a bit on the hokey side . it's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility dolph lundgren as the punisher , anyone ? , but this tries very hard . i've never read the actual comic book , but that doesn't really matter , i suppose . i judge a film mainly on its merits , not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea . unless its a film based on a true story , that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy . so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating ? because it tries . it tries very hard . in my book , that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film . many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus . it seems everybody has their take on vampire lore , be it the cross , the silver , the garlic , the aversion to sunlight , whatever . some of those ideas are included here . the storyline is familiar . a group of vampires conspire to take over the world , with one person mainly standing in their way . blade wesley snipes lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses , who have slowly but surely moved into the world , and share it with humankind . for the most part , the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them . the vampires have even taken familiars , people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turned . now that i think of it , there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the roddy piper film , they live . a hidden enemy , hidden group of people plotting against them , the fight to save human kind . all that is present in blade as well . the acting isn't the best here . snipes is , at best , only slightly better than some of his other roles ; n'bushe wright , a relative newcomer , isn't too bad ; kris kristofferson is forgettable as blade's sidekick he's to blade what chip is to the punisher . stephen dorff does the best job of the whole cast here , as the head vampire you just love to hate . i don't know , but i just loved the special effects in this film . from the blood soaked vampire style rave , all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film , the special effects aren't half bad . there's certainly enough blood and gore to go around , but after all , this is a vampire movie , right ? the various shapes and sorts of weaponry blade uses are fairly unique , and not generally used in contemporary action films . snipes has more flair with a decked out sword than he does with , say , a machine gun . plus , there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away . unless , of course , you are indiana jones . overall , this isn't the best action film ever made , but it's not half bad , either . as a bonus , the musical score soundtrack are pretty cool , too . tell me , in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like source direct or photek ? ! my rating 8 10",1,0
"the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point . it's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time , or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace . if only it was that easy . but the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better , as the situation gets worse and worse every single day . well , if you're not part of the solution , you're part of the problem . the central theme is that revenge begets more revenge , which begets even more , in an ever expanding bloodbath . both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side , which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation . where does it end ? and apparently he missed the significance of the bubble referred to in the name , which was that people living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them , which is partly why they seemed so naive . he also seemed to think that ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem , which tells me he wasn't paying attention when ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered . i found it very brave of the director , the screenplay writer , and both star crossed lovers , to update the romeo juliet story to a modern troubled land , and to make both lovers male . let's be honest here very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female young love wins all hearts but when people's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that , incredibly , these same people would rather have them hate each other , then the conclusion is inevitable .",1,0

"legend of dragoon is one of those little known games that people either love or hate . some people claim it's far too similar to other games , namely the final fantasy series which is understandable , since it was originally intended to be sony's equivalent of final fantasy . honestly i can't comment on the similarities beyond that , as i'm not very familiar with the ff games . i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system . not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form , but every time you attack , you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time . not only that , sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence , which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage . even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of button mashing . if you don't want to attack , you can always guard , which not only cuts any damage taken in half , but raises your hit points without the use of healing potions . the fmvs are quite well done , about the same quality as final fantasy 8's . however , the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard . they're nice , but they could have been and honestly , should have been better . the translation as well leaves something to be desired . not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions , but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldn't have been allowed to pass . another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party characters one dies , and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves . while the death of the one character is often said to have no point , it makes you realize early on that the characters , while heroes , are still just as mortal as the next person . the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats , so the transition game play wise is fairly smooth . perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love interest , shana . she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing , pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration . while you can use her in your party , she is insanely weak i don't even know what her dragoon powers are like , as i disliked her so much i never used her . the character rose , by contrast , is probably my favorite female character in any game ever . she's no wimp , and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful . meru is quite strong as well , while sometimes being an annoying talkative brat . the character designers were , as most are , inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever , and didn't give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits . seriously , no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters . but i will give them props , as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries . i can't comment much on the plot , as honestly i didn't pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next . i'm not sure if this says something about the plot itself , or my gaming style . all in all , it's a very enjoyable game . it has its flaws , but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters .",1,0

"i believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of 8000 but that didn't really show . there wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting , the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of aberdeen . the actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious , deserted and uncharted planet , none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive . there weren't any great explanations of what was going on , which can be really contrived , so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination rather like the big empty which was a film i also enjoyed . i found that i quite warmed to most of the characters , there were some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments , the men were so ordinary that you felt you could empathise with them and the film's climax and ending were quite poignant . i think mr stirton and his crew should be quite proud of themselves i've seen worse films with a budget of millions .",1,0

"the problem with tv today is that people have been spoiled by lite tv viewing . this type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or easy listening jazz . the typical viewers idea of continuity is remembering who got voted off the island last week and wondering who will be the next to go . show them a program like surface , firefly , dr . who , or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and . well , they'll just flip back to survivor . 95 of the sheep watching tv don't want to rack their brains . they want excuses to not think . they want to make sure the boob tube lives up to its name . and they don't want shows that try and go any other route . because of this , surface and many other high quality shows that should have lasted far longer have gotten the axe . tv viewers don't want stories , or morals , or philosophy , or anything over a third grade vocabulary level . they want people eating earthworms , or over dramatized real life series no such thing ! you cannot observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe or hormonal shows involving groups of people having trysts and then bragging about it to their friends . today's television is nothing but a wasteland , and the few diamonds you can pick out of the dust are just tossed out because no one even knows what a diamond is anymore . surface was one of those diamonds .",1,0

' . because she gets tortured for '45 min , without any reasons given in fact , there is nothing else in this movie ! fingernails teared off , beaten with hands , feet , tools , infested by maggots , . and many more until the final scene i'm still not sure how they did that . because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene' , it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money . so what were her their motivations ? i saw it in japonese without subtitles , but it's not a problem no real dialogues , the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes . i haven't seen yet all the serial , but the first guinea pig is not known for being the best one . still i've rated 8 , because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff , the issue is quite good ask charlie sheen , the actor . but i think they could have gone further , which they did in the following ones . another movie i'm hiding from my parents . 8 10",1,0

"when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long , i thought we were in trouble . condensing the gigantic w . somerset maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen . but you know , the movie's not half bad , and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers . i've heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet noodle of an actor , and he was , but i can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet noodle , for that's certainly what carey is . howard plays him well , which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly , then finally take him out and buy him a spine . ah , and then there's bette , as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him . i didn't know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book , and the movie stays true to that detail . but as played by davis , she does become the most fascinating character in the story , and if she's nasty and unlikable , she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time . davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting , much as brando's would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out stella ! in that little known tennesee williams play , and it's not hard to see why . davis is intense to the point of scary . she makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience , and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous . her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an std is shocking . of course , it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect ; if it had been made a year later , you can bet things would have been a bit different . yes , much of the novel , and many of its most interesting parts , are left on the cutting room floor , and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else . i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of maugham's novel , but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now , so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did . grade b",1,0

"i'm not sure where to start with this . in short , it was a disappointing movie . having taught the novella , i was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie . the movie has a couple of interesting lines mainly between alfred and aschenbach but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella . for one , i was expecting an older aschenbach and a younger tadzio . in the book , tadzio is fourteen , but he is described as pure , ideal , innocent , whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease . he is an accomplice to aschenbach , he always looks back at him , almost provokingly . in the book , it is aschenbach who steals glances at the boy . as for aschenbach , i imagined something closer to the professor turned clown in the blue angel based on a story by thomas mann's brother heinrich than this forty year old with hardly any gray hair . in all fairness , i do think that dirk bogarde did a good job , but either someone else should have done that , or he should have made to look older at the beginning . i know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story , but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the apollonian and dyonisian inspirations and focuses instead on aschenbach's obsession of tadzio and does not justify it . i liked the fact that mahler's music was used , because ultimately he did inspire mann to write his story . i'm not sure turning aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move . or the creation of alfred who i don't remember in the book . and one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips . i was wondering if it was dubbed because i expected it to be in italian . but then i remembered that each italian movie i have watched has this problem . it just bothers me because these directors fellini is the other person i'm thinking of are supposed to epitomize perfection in italian cinema , and here are their characters laughing without sound , then you hear a noise that doesn't correspond to their faces i'm thinking of the scenes when aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing . this scene could should have been the strongest , but it was annoying instead .",1,0

"american made final entry in the blood island series of filipino horror films concerns abdul amir reed hadley , ruler of a fictional country . he dies of cancer , yet it's figured out how to bring him back put his brain into a donor body . the mad doctor in charge kent taylor puts it in a highly unlikely body the facially scarred giant manservant named gor john bloom . a doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and put an end to the mad doctors' plans . film making partners samuel m . sherman producer and al adamson director corral several actors they've worked with before , including taylor , adamsons' sexy wife regina carrol , angelo rossitto , zandor vorkov , and vicki volante . they tried to go for the feel of the previous blood island entries but one can tell this was made stateside . while not necessarily a good film , it's got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole . a malevolent dwarf rossitto , gory operations , a rather unconvincing makeup job on bloom , the political intrigue subplot , caverns full of cobwebs , etc . the narrative is actually pretty coherent , with plot twists thrown in here and there . i think it could have been trimmed a bit ; some scenes drag . but it's got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect . for this kind of thing , the acting isn't too bad . both taylor and rossitto are fun ; the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role . volante is appealing enough , and williams is o . k . in the heroic role . in any event , it's nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films . absolutely nothing special , but as a trashy b horror i use the word loosely , none of this is exactly scary film , it certainly amuses . 7 10",1,0

"remember that friend in college who always insisted you rent the weirdest movie possible ? this is the movie he would have made if he'd had the chance . i wish i could tell you exactly what sea of dust was about . it pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the black forest . he goes there to help , but ends up being caught between two young women , both of whom he seems to have a thing for . but that's just scratching the surface . this is the kind of movie where things just randomly happen . and not nice thing . people are constantly being whipped and stabbed . there's a pair of creepy little girls who appear to have walked out of the shining . tom savini is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesn't want to be imaginary anymore . he's got a plan to take over the world by sharing jesus suffering . on some level , this is a movie about sex . it's one without nudity , which was a disappointment , but there's no mistaking the intent . on another whole level , it's a stoner's paradise . unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected . by the time the doctor travels through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn , you'll just chalk it up to the crazy nature of the flick . on the down side , the film is pretty wordy . some of the points are hammered home over and over . if you're watching it with a bunch of stoned friends , this might prove an asset .",1,0

"there's a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldn't direct a horror film of quality if he had to . and , sleepwalkers . screenplay written by stephen king is often used as an example of this . i like sleepwalkers , though i fully am aware that garris just says f ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie . forget character or plot development , who needs them anyway . it's about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkers . feline human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents , moving from town to town , living a nomadic existence , truly powerful set their sights on a teenager who doesn't surrender without a fight . before all is said and done , many will be slaughtered as a mother shan't tolerate the possible death of her beloved son . garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed , as a teacher glenn shadix , suspecting handsome , all american charmer charles brady brian krause to be someone entirely different from who he claims , gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into . charles lures pretty virgins into his arms , drawing their energy , in turn feeding his hungry mama , mary alice krige . the fresh new target is tanya robertson m dchen amick , and she seems to be easy pickens , but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle . thanks to a deputy's cat , clovis , mary's vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way . mary , come hell or high water , will retrieve tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying son . like many teenagers , i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies . such as amy dolenz , i was smitten with m dchen amick . she's simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles , unaware of his ulterior motives . i just knew that m dchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen , but this would never be the case . too bad because i would've welcomed her in the genre with open arms . krige is yummy as the menacing , damn sexy , but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanya's parents in one fail swoop , in less than ten or so minutes . she stabs one in the back with a corn cob ! she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman , before cracking his arm . a bone protruding , knocking him unconscious with his own elbow ! she tosses tanya's mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father's face ! a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles cop kebab ! , falling on the pencil for extra impact . poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary , driven to the brady home , and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster ! the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans . we see mary and charles' abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility . writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers , joe dante and john landis as photograph experts . the film is shot in a tongue in cheek , let it all hang out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home . it's about the ultra violence , simple as that , with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris' direction and king's screenplay . the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in your face . without a lick of complexity , this is closer in vein to king's own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works .",1,0

"if you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie , then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars ? it's not as if they're inexperienced in front of the camera , they have no qualms with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name ? christian viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema's sexiest and most notorious stars . jenna jameson , chasey lain , ginger lynn allen and taylor hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since scream reinvigorated the genre . samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in october 2002 thus keeping in check with the halloween based synopsis . unfortunately , the shoot was plagued by numerous problems , which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves . last i heard it had been signed by film 2000 here in the uk and was penned for a late october release direct to dvd . unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with dtv slashers . not content with polluting our shelves with camp blood and its follow up , they were also responsible for unleashing granny , bleed and the rancid paranoid . could samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon ? five canadian american students and their teacher head to southern ireland as part of their history course . upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of scotland and murdered locals for food . the cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake , but it's rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of ireland to find refuge . after the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre fodder does in these flicks , the mandatory goody two shoes and definite heroine candidate begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night . could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the forest ? well what do you think ? it looks as if samhain's production was jinxed right from the start . almost immediately wallmart refused to develop jenna jameson's nude make up shots , and chasey lain began acting characteristically like a drugged out primadonna . finally to add insult to injury , the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re editing and removing all the gore . reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an r rating . veil of course disagreed , seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display . eventually after months of arguments , the director parted company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults . despite countless disruptions , veil's slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium . the copy i was sent was the pre release screener , which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack . but still it boasted a few credible jump scares , some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that i've seen for some time . one guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine , jenna jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and chasey lain ends up 'spilling her guts' after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend richard grieco . even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome , samhain never feels mean spirited , which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clich s . in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall , because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes craven's scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them . certainly the inclusion of the mouth watering jenna jameson was a great move by the producers . her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top as expected and so does chasey lain and taylor hayes . but samhain is no soft porn movie , and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce . it's worth noting that the aforementioned xxx stars almost out perform the supposed 'actors' of the feature , which isn't much of a complement . ginger lynn was at least notable if you ignore the shameful 'oirish accent , and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan chou . taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics , which could have been caused by the numerous problems on set . veil's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much needed injections of suspense . exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds . it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of samhain . rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending , and i'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution . if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched , then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years . this one is certainly worth checking out",1,0
"i find it hard to believe this could happen at all . we do not know if justin and richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past . the movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble . so the first crime they commit is murder ? just to play and jostle with the cops ? how do they pick up any girl and just say you are it ? also richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle . hmmm . this whole concept is really hard to believe . that said let's move on . i found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then . as for cassie who was a victim of carl hudson has a horrible time trying to survive . the memory of having been stabbed 17 times by carl leaves her in an emotional mess . sandra does a superb acting job . she sure made me believe she was one angry cop . as for solving the crime , i thought it was great . this movie kept me planted in my chair . loved the acting of all but sam . he had no get up and go . the one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should i say the rape scene .",1,0
"as a big dostoyevsky fan , i had always been disappointed with hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the russian romantic aesthetic case in point , yul brynner as dmitri karamazov . i had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions , but then i saw yul as major surov and changed my mind . when given an intelligent script to work with , he suddenly came alive and was as noble , sexy , and conflicted as you could ever want a neurotic russian officer to be ! so he was a better dmitri as major surov than he was as dmitri . but that's because writer tabori actually gave yul , as the conflicted russian officer , the kind of conflicted russian officer lines that are worthy of real literature , and that have real meaning and pathos in them . for example , a propos of folk music , he says musingly , you hear a man crying in the dark . and if you listen carefully enough , you know what he cries for . you look surprised , lady ashmore . despite what you may have heard , tractors and marxism aren't the only things the russian cares for . there is always time for music . brilliant !",1,0

"when i first saw the premiere episode of farscape , i had no idea what to expect . i was immensely impressed and satisfied with premiere . subsequent re watches , however , have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially . premiere is not a great farscape episode , but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters . the episode begins with john crichton ben browder , an astronaut and scientist , preparing to launch into space in the farscape module , a small space ship perfected by crichton and his friend dk . crichton has a revealing conversation with his father , jack crichton , and then begins his test flight in space . of course , everything goes wrong and crichton is shot through a wormhole and winds up in a distant part of the galaxy . after exiting the wormhole , crichton's module is pulled on board a living space ship . from here , the characters and story line for the farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner . the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode . of course , there is crichton , played well by ben browder . he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with . he's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything . in premiere , crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeepers . he knows nothing at all about either side , but in helping aeryn a captured peacekeeper pilot it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers . he probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for crais , a peacekeeper captain , declaring crichton to be the murderer of his brother . this puts crichton in an interesting situation he's stuck with bizarre , violent escaped prisoners in a far off galaxy about which he knows nothing at all . crichton's total lack of knowledge of the farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during farscape's first season . the supporting cast is just as compelling . there's zhaan , a blue delvian and former prisoner . she's peaceful and reasonable , as opposed to fellow prisoner ka d'argo , a powerful and hard headed warrior . virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup , allowing her character of zhaan to appear cool and convincing . d'argo's mega makeup , in contrast , is below par . he looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose , and there is something peculiar about his eyes . they look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup . farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in season 1 , but the overall costume would , for me at least , remain as a problem until season 2 . the puppet digital characters of rygel and pilot are , to put it simply , excellent . rygel is a tiny hynerian dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft . in premiere he is given some good dialogue but not much else . pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship , moya , and moya's passengers . even in the first episode , pilot gives off the appearance of being a real , living alien ; he never once in the show seems to be a giant , expensive machine . the peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well . the peacekeepers are made up of a race called sebaceans , who look just like humans . the chief antagonist is introduced in premiere as captian crais , who believes that crichton killed his brother . in reality , crais's brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with crichton's ship . aeryn sun , a pilot who crichton helps escape , tries to explain that the death was an accident , but crais just claims that she is irreversiby contaminated and refused to change his mind . crais obsession for revenge , warranted or not it should be clear to crais that crichton isn't responsible , is mysterious in premiere , but would be explained later in the season . aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character . by being forced to leave the peacekeepers , she changes her whole way of life , and is in that regard in a similar though less severe situation as crichton . the actual episode , as mentioned earlier , feels somewhat rushed and clunky . so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything . also , d'argo for now looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing . still , premiere is solid entertainment . the special effects such as in the starburst sequences are impressive . most of the costumes and the sets on board moya are original . despite its flaws , premiere is a must see for farscape fans . 3 4",1,0

"last night , i saw a peck on the cheek kannathil muthamittal with english subtitles . oddly , it was 137 minutes long slightly longer than the time listed on imdb . at first , i found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me . the context for what was occurring was missing and i am glad i stuck with it . at the beginning , a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding , war breaks out in their native sri lanka and the lovers are separated . months later , the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to india . at a refugee center , you see the lady about to give birth after which the titles to the film finally are revealed . the entire focus of the film then changes completely to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in madras , india . you see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family . none of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing what about the lady who was about to give birth ? my wife and i debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film . somehow or another , she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad 2 though she did not realize these people were not her biological parents . soon after this , the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots one of the complaints i had about the film , as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage and tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused . despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way , the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother . seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents particularly the adoptive mother was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interest . unfortunately , sri lanka has been involved in a very , very long and brutal civil war with tamilese militants , off and on , for three decades . the family's decision to look for the mom back in sri lanka was indeed noble , but also a bit stupid at times as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war ! this was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents first you tell her she isn't your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a war zone ! sure , the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother , but this really was stupid in hind sight . if it were me , i might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid thus avoiding being in the middle of a war ! despite my complaints , the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding . far from perfect , it sure hits an emotional home run . also , while i expected this because i have seen several indian films , many westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where this is standard in most films from india including those made in bollywood bombay and tamilwood kollywood madras .",1,0

"as shallow as it may sound , i actually delayed my viewing of the barbarians several times just because the vhs cover as well as the picture image displayed here on the website looks so incredibly gay ! by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isn't so much gay . just trashy , cheesy , campy and enormously fun ! it's almost unbelievable that ruggero deodato , director of cannibal holocaust of all people , was the man responsible for this comical cash in on the contemporary popular sword sandal fantasy flicks , particularly schwarzenegger's conan movies . the film opens with a terrific 'once upon a time' type of off screen narrator , introducing us to the ragneks . their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers . in other words , the ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks ! their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy kadar kidnaps the ragneks' beautiful queen canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby . meanwhile , and as some sort of amusing waste of time , the two orphan twin brothers gore and kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and they're unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death . instead of that , however , they escape and develop a plan to free their queen . actually , the plot isn't half as bad as i initially feared , but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers' on screen chemistry , the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy monsters , like a dragon with adorably cute eyes , some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp . the soundtrack and make up effects are great and our almighty director deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace . the barbarian brother's acting capacities are much better than i anticipated , apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds . the supportive cast is splendid as well . eva la rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl cara , virginia bryant is indeed bewitching like richard lynch states on several occasions and the lovely sheeba alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut shaped hair style i kid you not ! . last but not least , the barbarians stars everybody's favorite eyes in the hills creep michael berryman as the appropriately named dirtmaster . i know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the village people , but the barbarians really is a must see italian exploitation highlight .",1,0
"this is another classic seagal movie . he walks , no , cruises through the patriot just all the other mega seagal movies . nothing even comes close to challenging seagal in this movie except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for this so called 'plague' and he starts throwing things about the lab but it all works out , i mean lets face it , its master seagal , he's got to win . what about his outfit in the film , masterpiece , he must have picked it himself . its great that everyone in the film is dying after being exposed to the virus but seagal doesn't even get a cough . the incident at the end when he kills the fat guy with the broken glass , genius , i bet seagal thought of that one as well . this film is class pure and simple . great plot , great characters , and seagal .",1,0

"in my line of work , i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film . when i can , i take a look at these low budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs . once in a while , though , there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire , as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible . the short film b r o k e n , directed by alex ferrari , is a genuine surprise and worth a second look . clocking in at a scant 20 minutes , b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story . the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening . a young woman samantha jane polay awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home . when she awakes , she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book . these nasty guys and girls are larger than life . they are all guns and knives . there is no way out . the kicker here is that , despite being a low budget film it doesn't play like one . from the very beginning , the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot , edited , and produced by professionals . it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers . the film is sharp and cool , it looks good and it feels like something big . the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films . polay and paul gordon who plays the head killer , duncan were well chosen . as two of the few speaking roles in the film , it is up to them to carry the film . no special effects , no matter how good , would have saved this film from bad acting . thankfully , polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho . some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent , but it hardly shows . the downside to b r o k e n is that it's only 20 minutes long . the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle . watching it , i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany , but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be . the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop , but it comes off as unsatisfying . i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film . my rating 8 out of 10 .",1,0
"this is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired , or impaired in some other way . the acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional , and to let you know how bad the special effects are , there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet , moving it about . the movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder . when i saw this movie for the first time , a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and i were calling each other names from this flick , that's how terrible it was . if you enjoy getting mad at movies , i recommend this to you , otherwise , flee as though your very life depended on it .",1,0
"a very credible and unsettling movie portraying the effects of war on the general public , shame gives us a chilling understanding oh ingmar bergman's beliefs . the absence of color and sound as in a soundtrack helps to give the film a more realistic feeling . there is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect . everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality . at times the storyline was confusing , but perhaps in order to give a sense of the characters' frame of mind how they too do now know what is happening or why . the simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring , but i could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and points . he depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war . in the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long , drawn out shots . when all of a sudden the war struck upon them , they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots . bergman did a good job on allowing us to be consumed by the war ourselves and presenting an image of it the so adequately corresponded to war . although the storyline itself was not too impressive , the content of the film was .",1,0
"remember greg the bunny ? it was this show that started on the independent film channel , but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox . my cousin and i thought it was pretty funny , beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on tv pg material . puppets who kill occurs in a similar universe , where puppets live in the same world as people , and like us , take on jobs and lives of their own . let's just say if you couldn't handle that , then don't bother watching pwk , as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of society's good graces through drug abuse , hedonism and violent felonies only to end up in a half way house . there's plenty of violence , sex , and bad language so it would never make its way to u . s . network tv . as if sociopathic puppets weren't enough , the fact that this takes place in canada makes it even more disturbing btw , the government pays for this , and i think any american television viewer would demand more demented cable tv fodder like this . i don't know where you can get it in the u . s . , beyond extra satellite tv , but i'd advise you give it a try . really funny stuff . it airs on the comedy network in canada",1,0
"punishment park is a pseudo documentary made by peter watkins . the premise is that the nation's dissidents hippies , musicians , protesters , pacifists , etc . are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of punishment park . it's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an american flag , with police , national guard , and various other authority figures in pursuit . the idea is , that if you make it to the flag , you're set free . the tribunal consists of a bunch of conservative types , all condemning any behavior that is not like their own , and there is no result except a prison sentence or the option of punishment park for any of those on trial . there are a lot of things in this that still ring true today , which is quite disturbing in itself . the people running the course are promised water at the half way point , which isn't true , and the pursuing officials are mostly a sadistic bunch that are just out for a bit of target practice . this is not a very graphic film but it's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else . the scary thing is , it could happen . not a very upbeat film but definitely worth seeing . warning it might make you angry . 9 out of 10 .",1,0

"the brain that wouldn't die was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962 . today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959 ; the thing is both lurid and lewd , but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way . the story , of course , concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab . with the aid of a few telephone cords , a couple of clamps , and what looks very like a shallow baking pan , he brings her head back to life . but is she grateful ? not hardly . in fact , she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing , particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body . as it happens , the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed , and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks , haunting strip joints , visiting body beautiful contests , and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow . but back at the lab , the head has developed a chemically induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments , this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet . can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance , wreck revenge upon the doctor , and save the woman whose body he hankers for ? could be ! leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of spanish fly ; virginia leith , the unhappy head , screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords . busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music , actors make irrational character changes from line to line , the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot , and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs . on the whole the brain that wouldn't die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie . director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip , and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors , who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it . the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost , but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release , and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with . now , this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious , depending on your point of view , so it is very hard to give a recommendation . but i'll say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers , you need to snap this one up and now ! four stars for its cheesy bizarreness alone ! gft , amazon reviewer",1,0

"one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun exciting for the cast and crew ; i could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm dedication because they apparently liked the people involved . i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart , and i think this is one such work . the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual , maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress director , and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent , watchable piece of art . the critiques of this film that more or less say , why not just rent a hardcore porn movie , make the point as to why they didn't like the film . going to this film hoping for a lot of t a without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them . one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie , even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn . i think she graduated . in terms of the writing , the dialog is not a huge part of the movie , like in a tarentino film , but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun . particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure , with the villianess heroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings . i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this . hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride . gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot , not just airhead bimbos , so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art , even with the limits of b movie land , not disappointing .",1,0
"separate lies changed my life . actually , the q a did . spoilers below . read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it the emily watson character cheats on the tom wilkonson character . my first reaction to the puppy dog eyed emily was it's over . dump her . bad riddance . for some reason , he stuck around . not in a pathetic way . he just listened . and tried to accept her needs . at times he needed to leave . but he stuck by her and let her live her life . but i still wanted to see her afterwards , julian , the screenwriter and director , talked about the film . i'm glad he did , because frankly i am too you and was too immature to get the point before he broke it down for me . tom's character loved her , and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs might disagree with what he wants , he would always love her . the relationship and love they shared wasn't a lie , all of a sudden , just because she wanted to be with someone else . the fact that she wanted to be with someone else didn't make her who she was . when you get past fifty , there's a strong chance that finding the love of your life won't come around again , so you can't be as dismissive as you were when you were younger . you have to try and make things work , because the alternative may be much worse . she needed what she needed , and she couldn't help that . he had to learn to let go of her if he wanted to be the full man he could be . he helped her in pursuit of her lover , even when it hurt him . another thing julian said that the strongest tool of a controller is guilt . again the strongest tool of a controller is guilt . at the end of the film , tom released her from her burden . he felt a need to let her know that he loved her , but not to in order to get her back ; he wanted to let her know she didn't need to feel guilty or think poorly about the relationship , just because it ended in such a terrible way . it is not my way to review a film based on the message , rather than the execution , especially when i understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director , but i make an exception here , as i feel one more mature than i would benefit from seeing the film . the execution of the film making was a nice , british pace . rupert was slimy and revolting . tom and emily were their usually solid , real characters .",1,0
"okay , this wasn't the greatest horror movie i've ever seen in my life . despite the fact that it's lower budget , it's a pretty decent movie , though . the monsters are unique and believable . heck , they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family . although , when you finally do get to see the monsters completely , you really think wtf ! ? those itty bitty things are after them ? ! the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty ! not the kitty , noooooo , why ? seriously though , if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore , this is not the movie for you . go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines . if you have small children , i wouldn't recommend watching this with them though ; probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room .",1,0
"the movie actually has a fairly good story , but gets bogged down in several key places . it's almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film . dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role . but something is clearly missing from several key scenes . this 2 . 5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie . and probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together .",1,0
"i had been long awaiting this movie ever since i saw the trailer , which made it look like a political drama , starring three of my favorite actors ; al pacino , john cusack , and bridget fonda . and even though it was directed by harold becker , who has done uneven work , he and pacino did combine on sea of love , which ranks among each of their best work . but interference on some level for starters , several of the scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie and changing of tone subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller make this , while watchable , nowhere near as it could have been . which is too bad , because i really wanted to like this movie . there was great potential here to be a film about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption , and to make a complex statement about that corruption , not the usual good guys vs . bad guys . and there is good acting here . pacino and cusack are both very good , and danny aiello gives one of the best performances of his career . but fonda is wasted in her role , having nothing to do , and while there is merit in the central storyline , when it turns to a thriller , the movie loses its way , briefly recovers in the final scene between cusack and pacino , and then falls down completely in the end . i wish i could like this more , but no .",1,0
"i'm a fan of c c , going back to their records , and liked this movie , but at one point in the mid 1980's on cable television in san jose california , it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie . all references to marijuana were replaced with diamonds . the bag that red drops to chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana , but the conversation still remains the same . it's worth 3000 lb . there is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing c c , and talking to each other about getting the diamonds . at the end , instead of space coke , it's something else . i'm not sure who created this version , but it was horrible , and obvious that they were attempting to make it family child friendly . it would have been better if that network had not aired it at all .",1,0
"china o'brien 1990 was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states . this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse . sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director . the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms . rothrock and richard norton . if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight to video action flick . china o'brien returns home to help out her dad . he's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help . so she returns home and restores order with the help of two unlikely people . but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies ? if you're a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you . i only enjoyed the fighting scenes , everything else is rubbish . why didn't raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director ? recommended .",1,0
"i must say , i thought i had seen it all . i am an extremely jaded movie buff . this movie didn't shock me , by any means . i'm way past that point . but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn't know i could go to . i had no idea i could ever find ick the idea of beastiality erotic . never never never . ever . ever . but there you go . he did it . i have to give the director credit . he pulled it off . for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore . we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex . after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn't a mistake . then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married . then some nervous guy shaves . then we see briefly a hot chick getting it on with a butler but this is very brief . at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake . in fact , i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night . we finally get the good stuff when a girl who knows who she is , or who anyone is in this movie has a dream about a victorian era gal being ravaged by a beast thing in the forest . the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat heh heh of the whole deal . it's beautifully shot , superbly edited , and does deliver the goods . they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn't either . oh well . i would definitely recommend this film . the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself and my tv but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it .",1,0
"after all the crap that hollywood and the indies have churned out , we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments . there are some clich d moments , but i'm not sure it's possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie . there's not much new here . it's just done well . make sure and pay attention , as the subtle scares come quickly and often . this is not a movie to watch while you're eating pizza . there's one very well written red herring in this movie and , unfortunately , one very poorly cast role . cheri christian just doesn't make an effective julie the wife mother . for one thing , she's totally unsympathetic . i know , i know . she's just gone through a traumatic experience . but the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting in an unintentional way . i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her , but i never did . finally , a thumbs up for the ending , which is both disturbing and satisfying . it could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits , but the director wisely resisted . this is not a masterpiece by any means , but it is a good , old fashioned scary movie . something that's rather rare nowadays .",1,0
"three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another . the one hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over . i have seen other segments of the dekalog but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure . the film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder . obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen at least in the short 1 hr version of dekalog 5 . we are made to imagine that this must have been the case . a cab driver who is a misanthrope , has two facets to his character the good side feeds a mangy dog , cleans his cab meticulously , picks up dirty rags thrown by people who lack civic sense , and remembers his wife while dying ; the bad side frightens small poodles , refuses to give a ride to a drunk probably worried that he will puke in the cab and ogles at pretty girls . the repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy , drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic , and pushes strangers into urinals without any provocation , is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh . kieslowski's film and the script thus present the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters . yet the film is not about capital punishment but more a treatise on killing . the fifth commandment thou shalt not kill is explored theologically even god spared cain . ' , sociologically the tenderness of brutes to children and poor forlorn dogs , and psychologically after effects of drunken night with a male friend that led to the accidental death of his sister , whose photograph he carries with him . what makes ordinary persons turn into killers this is never fully explained but suggestions are legion . in kieslowski's world there is a pattern where events and people are interlinked in a cosmic sense note the resemblance of clown to the killer , as it hangs from the mirror in the cab . kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to ask us to look at the commandment literally and figuratively why do we kill ? are the people legally killed truly bad ? is there a force beyond society the drunken night that led to life of a girl that makes us into abhorrent murderers ? it would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two detailed killings in the film both without mercy . the film invites the viewer to contemplate why we are asked by god not to kill . i understand a longer full length version of the film was made by kieslowski . but even this short 1 hr version is superb with its bleak and sparse script , intelligent editing , interesting cinematography and top notch direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts . this segment anticipates the more wholesome dekalogs 6 , 7 and 8 .",1,0
"there should be more movies about our native americans . i especially think that using actual real native americans , would be the the right thing . i know that this archie belaney , who was played by pierce brosnan he did an excellent job in portraying that character , since he was an englishman . but my suggestion to hollywood , is to put more american indians into the roles , and never use anyone else . the sioux nation has been put on the back burner far too long . their poverty is a disgrace to our country . it is my firm belief that our country should return the black hills to the sioux . we ask israel to return their lands to the arabs , but we do not make any effort to do the same , we should be ashamed of ourselves . we must practice what we preach !",1,0
"this 1955 producers' showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of showcasing most of the original broadway cast , including kathleen nolan as wendy , who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color televised play . it's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production which doesn't even show up in the imdb listings when you put peter pan into the search engine ! is superior to the cutesier color version most people have watched . i obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally . now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison . i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b w producers' showcase televised version . as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening promo . how far away the 1950's seem now such an innocent time compared to today . i miss it .",1,0
"strangely , this version of open your eyes is more mature and more nuanced . aided by hindsight , crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than amenabar's original . the spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first , but there's no doubt that crowe has improved on it if just slightly . notice that you have no idea what the lead did in open your eyes , but you know almost everything about the lead in vanilla sky . that's what i mean by more fleshed out .",1,0
"rko radio pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to get it nominated for the best picture academy award . the acting , script , continuity , et cetera , are all just about perfect ; and the story is well worth the viewer's 82 minutes . although the picture soft petals the true life story by making the murder victim a jew rather than a homosexual , most viewers will see the victim as a jewish homosexual such disguises never work , perhaps weren't intended to . i could nit pick about a few details , but just for fun . there was no all night movie house in washington , dc in 1947 and if there was i wish robert mitchum and his pal wouldn't talk through the show . there weren't any bars where a gi could pick up a pretty blonde . none ! if robert ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop he ought to have bought the daily news ; not the times hearald , evening star and certainly not the know nothing washington post . but these little things take nothing away from this classic . the film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of a musical score , except during the credits . i've only seen this done in a few films . on the negative side , since 1995 it comes with a tmc introduction where some liberal blabs about what the public was ready for in 1947 . blah , blah , blah ! as if this fool has any business judging his betters . i'd say the ex gi's in 1947 the greatest generation were much smarter and had better values than some commentator , film historian , or other wise mouth in 1995 . put a sock in it !",1,0

"comanche moon had everything going for it . for starters , simon wincer's back , a man who's name is synonymous with high quality tv westerns . unfortunately , the problems with moon are something even the most talented director couldn't solve a poor script based on a lackluster novel . forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you , the biggest travesty in moon is that it's not even consistent with information from the original lonesome dove masterpiece . so many wonderful , rich moments in the miniseries and , to an even greater degree , the book , are completely missing in moon . considering the fact that most viewers of moon are probably coming with at least some sort of dove background , the lack of character driven and emotional backstory is downright painful . that said , moon is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen . for example , the novel moon focuses largely on the comanches themselves . to its credit , the miniseries tries to service the comanches , but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story . similarly , val kilmer's scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so kilmer and rachel griffiths , for that matter actually had something to do , or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller , supporting parts . instead , kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act . there's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book a killer parrot ? what ? further , there isn't a single scene that shows us that call and mccrae are anything near the amazing texas rangers they claim to be . not a single one of their expeditions in moon or dead man's walk , for that matter ends successfully , and call and mccrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another . frankly , larry mcmurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script , and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie , brokeback mountain . mcmurtry can write good novels although there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement , but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter . this production would have benefited from not only bringing back director wincer , but original screenwriter bill wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen . witcliff doesn't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit , but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original lonesome dove . with all this said , comanche moon is almost a brilliant production , aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do . steve zahn's portrayal of gus mccrae or rather , his portrayal of robert duvall as gus mccrae is dead on . and while some have criticized karl urban as woodrow call , saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet , stoic woodrow of the original movie , all i can say is blame mcmurtry , because mcmurtry is the one who both in the moon novel and now the miniseries turned woodrow from socially inept , awkward , but natural leader , into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel . still , it's the cast that sparkles in moon , to the degree that i left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy i felt watching the original lonesome dove this time because i realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long , long time to come and quite honestly , this cast could have done so well in a well nurtured , full blown network tv series . all in all , aside from wasted opportunities with the cast , the biggest travesty is that the original lonesome dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating , utterly fascinating , to see translated on screen . unfortunately , all that has been tossed aside in favor of mcmurtry's tedious , inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant , prequel .",1,0
"this is a cute little horror spoof comedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira mistress of the dark , the most infamous horror hostess of all time . this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network . they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit com never made it past the pilot stage due to it's sexual references . this film however , is very amusing . elvira is the modern day chesty morgan and the queen of the one liners . this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal elvira's haunted hills which was meant to be a take off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on it's face . watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience !",1,0
"hrm i think that line was from the old movie posters . this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator . here's a tip any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading in the future . is going to be fun . this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you . in this case , in the future . means that , instead of fighting wars , nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine , well , that's never terribly clear , but it's probably something really important . there are good guys obviously capitalists , i . e . us and bad guys commies ! and there are big stop motion robots . sadly , the effects budget was pretty slim , so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots . there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes , and then a big space fight near the end . the space fight is especially nice , as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget . with said money now spent , the climactic fight degenerates into and i'm not making this up two guys hitting each other with sticks . i can always get a laugh in a bar by re enacting the final scene , complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads . like i said it's dumb . that's why i bought the tape .",1,0
"the very few reviews i could find online of barnens really do not do it justice . i read them all before ordering the dvd , but for some reason i ordered it anyway . i regretted it almost immediately , but the order had already gone through so i couldn't cancel it . i'm very glad now that i couldn't . it's an extraordinary movie . i won't give a synopsis of the plot , because other reviewers have already done that . but i will say that i don't understand comments that it's bleak , shocking , weird , clinical , depressing or pornographic . it is certainly very unusual , which i suppose could make it seem weird to some people , but the other criticisms must reflect the reviewers' own issues , because i didn't see any of that in the movie i just watched . i'm not attracted to boys , so the nudity didn't seem pornographic at all to me it's just a kid trying to figure out who he is with no help at all from the irresponsible adults in his life . and it's sweden , not utah , so topless women are no big deal . but what surprised me most is how positive the movie is in its depiction of this gutsy lost kid who goes on a sort of odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences , looking for and ultimately finding himself . it's fascinating , thoroughly original , and deeply satisfying . i'm not at all surprised that barnens won three major guldbagge awards , for best film , direction , and actor , but i'm absolutely astounded that the actor who won was not tomas fryk , the kid whose fearless performance as reine must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed , but ingvar hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of stig , reine's mother's sleazy boyfriend . i don't understand that at all , but it doesn't alter the fact that this is a great movie .",1,0
"for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart , this is one of his lesser films from later in his career . and , while it isn't a great film compared to many of his other pictures , it isn't bad and is a decent time passer but not much more . kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason , she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her . over time , the cold and detached ms . novak also begins to fall in love with stewart and apparently in the witch's rule book , this is a definite no , no ! the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches . they are neither the baby sacrificing nor the all powerful variety . most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps . and , very oddly , the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz . considering what i think of jazz , it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world ! anyway , the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic , but not something i would rush out to watch . the acting is pretty good , but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film in fact , i almost scored the film a 6 it was really close .",1,0

"i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod . if you don't expect anything else , such as clever plot twists and believable character development , you won't be disappointed . consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people , especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy' suzanna arquette , who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten she leaves that up to her daughter . mandy's face is a little too perfect , but her body is a complete 5 alarm fire , up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness , a perfect 7 to 10 ratio of waist to hips , and splendidly configured legs , right down to her feet . there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye ; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio . and no flat butt to boot , which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres' . mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle lit hot tub with her blindfolded german guy victim no . 2 , but from all i could see from her bikini shots , she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it . mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl' , with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones . her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no . 2 , who also happened to be her mother's lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise one dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason . mandy's uber nordic facial features coupled with her uber voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse . if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress , i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages , especially italian and spanish and maybe french , although i don't know if they would go for her type . but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic , and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground . vambo drule .",1,0
"honestly , i was expecting to hate this one , and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it . but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed . a group of college kids and their teacher go on a field trip to ireland . their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace . the group of post teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods but being the stupid b movie characters that they are of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one by one . first off , there is plenty wrong with evil breed . the acting dialog is pretty weak , and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson , chasey lain , ginger lynn , and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here and jenna's role in this production is grossly over hyped , as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time . even less with chasey , and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever . also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film . those gripes aside there is some good stuff as well . richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on , with greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey's guts hanging out from being torn in half though how she ends up this way isn't shown on screen . not bad for the first 5 minutes . the other kill scenes are pretty inventive , including jenna's forced breast implant removal , a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass , a knife through the face , and a few other notables . the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em , so to speak . also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored . the creature fx are also done competently which definitely helps . overall , evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected . this one , along with satan's little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low budget straight to video films . i usually steer clear of them as a whole , but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith . evil breed is no masterpiece , but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it i know i was , and i'm sure it didn't hurt the experience . 7 . 5 10",1,0

"i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th , knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy adventure quest of some sort . the plot line really is nothing like i have seen , and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters . in spite of what first impressions may give , it isn't cheesy , corny , tacky , or ridiculous , and is actually highly entertaining and funny . the flow is quite well done , nothing seems rushed or dragged out . the soundtrack , for lack of better words , is magical and adds much to the film , as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv . and even though i might have known what was coming at points , i still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen ; to my knowledge , not a single person left the theater during the entire movie . my one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film , and as brilliant as it is i can't figure out why .",1,0
"no matter how much it hurts me to say this , the movie is not as good as it could have been . maybe i was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews here on imdb , but i expected so much more . sure , the idea is a good one , the violent scenes and the camera work are outstanding , the imagination of genius dario is breathtaking , but the movie is soiled by a couple of mistakes that i find unforgivable . first of all , am i one of the few people who feel that the heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere apart ? with a different kind of music goblin ? during the needle scenes , it would have been soooo intense ! . instead , the soundtrack destroys any chance for tension . secondly , the final killing scene and the last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired . i don't want to say amateurish , cause i love argento's movies . the ending left me feeling empty . talk about a final impression ! this is hardly what happens in most of dario's films ! though , admittedly , suspiria also suffers from a rushed finale even if most of it is brilliant . in short , watch this movie , try to make the most of its good points , but be prepared for some bad ones as well . this is not a perfect movie by any means .",1,0

"i love kristen dunst , especially in elizabethtown . i guess she's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera , but just be herself . she did that , and she looked so natural in elizabethtown . in this movie , however , she did try to add in more artificial performance , especially in the first half of the film , so that she looked more like a sober editor . while in the other half , she totally set herself back in her daily track , and i just couldn't tell her to be an editor any way . therefore , her performance is not enduring in this film . the film , on the whole , is attracting and inspiring . the character of young is full and reasonable . anyway , the film tells a big and sophisticated story . the only big defect is that it didn't show a turning point of the hero and heroine's love story . i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story , because that is rather unclear for the two persons .",1,0

"one of the most unfairly maligned programmes of all time , 'terry june' was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the '70's and '80's . it started life as 'happy ever after' , but when eric merriman decided he didn't want to write any more , it changed into this , hence the dropping of 'aunt lucy' and the fletcher's becoming the medford's . yes , it was cosy , domestic , middle class stuff ; the plots ran the gamut of clich s from the boss coming to dinner , the vicar organising a jumble sale , and unwanted relatives coming to stay for the weekend . it was certainly not 'dreadful lazy comedy' . as for it being 'not clever' , it was not meant to be . it was funny and well performed , and that was enough ! i too loved the 'alternative' boom of the '80's 'spitting image' , 'black adder' , 'the young ones' etc . but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this . if nothing else , it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to . i found it sad though when the likes of ben elton took against both this and benny hill . well , family oriented comedy has all but vanished from our screens , but where has it left us ? take a look at the latest t . v . schedules . all soaps and reality dross . the few comedies left are aimed at teenagers , meaning they are jam packed with swearing , bodily function jokes , and explicit sexual references . and they are not remotely funny either . the 'alternative comedy' boom was good in many ways , but had a dark side . it made conventional sitcoms appear old fashioned , drove away talented writers and performers such as spike milligan , and ultimately led to such unspeakable drivel as 'little britain' and 'tittybangbang' heaven help us . if it ain't broke , don't fix it !",1,0
"this movie has to be my favorite of all time . its not supposed to have a plot , because its makers wanted people charlie sheen , i think to believe it was a real snuff film . this was an exercise in visual effects , and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does . movies these days are now all about sound effects , leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood . there still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing . there is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film . have you seen the hills have eyes 2 ? the rape scene was funny instead of shocking . although i'm sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror . but since they probably suck at making films , they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off . the movie baise moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks . its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all , especially when talking about an ao or nc 17 rating . i'm sure eli roth has the ability talent to make his hostel film series much much better , but he has too tame it down to get an r rating . or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations . watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident crime scenes footage . don't forget that this movie was made in 1985 . the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film . that would be like someone saying the 8bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps3 has better graphics .",1,0

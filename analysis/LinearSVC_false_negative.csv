"i think dirty dancing was a great movie , they tried to make another one havana nights which was good but it was nothing like dirty dancing . i would like to see another dirty dancing with the same people . without them i think it would be a mess . a lot of times movies are made then when they try to add on more they start to change the people an make the movies go down hill . i would love to see dirty dancing have another one to see what happened after they were able to be together . patrick an jennifer did so well together . this movie was made in 1997 its time to make another one . but this time start where it left off an keep the same people in it .",1,0
"what alice found is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of ! i underestimated it when i heard of it , and i though that it would all sex , no plot , and just really stupid , but in reality , it was really good . they say all indie movies suck , but this one , and napoleon dynamite didn't suck . i asked my friend , who'd seen it before i did , and she said that alice has all these threeways , and you see all this nudity , but no , there is no threeway that i remember , and little nudity . the movie did have a point , and it taught me never trust hitchhikers . i liked that in the end , they got alice a little dolphin in the end , on her way to flordia . i totally suggest seeing this movie .",1,0
"i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out . br br since i had already seen the original , when i saw this on sci fi channel i don't know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi i knew what it was within the first few minutes . since i like richard burgi as a character actor , i wanted to see how he would pull it off . br br the writersproducers etc , modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the aliens they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90's . maybe it added a bit of polish to the film , or not . br br this film . film ? this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place , although no resolution of the alien's problem . br br i sort of remember that in this remake , the woman became rather hostile towards the burgialien i think it could have ended better . but the ending is just the ending , and the yarn is a swell yarn , being of the basic 1958 science fiction pulp stock . many great science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some of them even made it to film . br br this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something . i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50's sci fi , this one came off well . i actually enjoyed this quite a bit . br br but if anyone really wants to see this story told well , i suggest the original 1958 version with tom tyron and gloria talbott , directed by gene fowler jr .",1,0
"twisted desire 1996 was a tv movie starring melissa joan hart . melissa's character , jennifer stanton , a seventeenyearold seduces her current boyfriend nick ryan into murdering her two parents . the movie is based on the 1990 murders of the parents of 14 year old jessica wiseman . jessica had her 17 year old boyfriend douglas christopher thomas shoot and kill her parents ! thomas was executed in 2000 ! jessica was released from prison when she turned 21 years old . evidence now suggests that it was jessica who fired the fatal shot that killed her mother . jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of virginia .",1,0

the good thing about this film is that it stands alone you don't have to have seen the original . unfortunately this is also it's biggest drawback . it would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had developed . sinclair as in the original is excellent and provides the films best comic moments as he attempts to deal with awkward and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original movie . forsyth is to be congratulated on a brave attempt to move the character on and create an original sequel but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original,1,0
"financially strapped paramount pulled out all the stops for this '34 stage adaptation entry big budget , large cast , extravagant production and mitch leisen tagged as the director . what happened ? two things busby berkeley didn't work for the outof focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst charlie chan first draft down the street . i have to believe that the cutting was out of leisen's hands since the great duke ellington's number is savagely chopped , but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look the 'sweet marihuana' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower , considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied jack oakie . carl brisson's acting is bland as melba toast but he's a competent singer . maclaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective . and try to spot lucy in the chorus . this rates a 7 . 0 as a curiosity . feb 2010 rethink i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was wrong to berate the lack of busby berkeley production numbers . i can understand leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot . i still have enormous issues with the editing however . paramount , the raciest major studio in town , faced huge issues with the production code at the worst possible time in it's history , financially speaking , and pulled out all the stops on this one also check out 1934's search for beauty . a must see for precode buffs .",1,0
"a very strange , disturbing but intriguing film . i don't think i ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt , and i doubt if i'll ever want to see it again . that said , there is much to be amused by , like divine's take on jayne mansfield's classic walk in the girl can't help it and putting slabs of meat between her legs in a grocery store . a gritty feel very much like a russ meyer film . generally poor acting , with the notable exception of divine .",1,0
"this is not a serious film , and does not pretend to be , but it is not as bad as some of its reviews , it's title , and the first ten minutes lead you to expect . br br the plot is very silly , but this adds to the lighthearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film . the characters are played sympathetically , and while they do engage in typical teenage angst , they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre . br br unusually set in london , sympathetic to geeks , this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on ; if you want some tongueincheek silliness , and don't mind suspending your disbelief .",1,0

"bela made 9 pics for monogram , but it was only at this one , the 4th , that things started to come together . all the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production , writing and character development . from here on , better or worse , the series would also deal with one essential theme a scientist usually bela makes experiments in the basement or the old house sometimes in the basement in the old house that causes things to go blooey . this was also the first time that art director dave milton got a chance to spread his wings . he came on board for black dragons , the flick before , but this one is where he gets to make his craft start to click . lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing , and was around for all the rest of the monograms . casting is key in these , and it's a pretty good one b movie wise , here . you get barclay and harlen also from black dragons , along with russell , who would star in lewtons' cat people movies . . and rosetto , from spooks run wild . . . a nice slice of poverty row talent . if you have limited time and budget , start with this one . . . it sums up everything they had learned up to this point , and gives you something to compare the rest to . the plot ? bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young . they both like to sleep in coffins . if you can read that and smile , the rest will be easy .",1,0
the knowledge is a typical british comedy for the period . to someone who is not familiar of the process of becoming a london cabby the film is bound to seem very average with a few laughs from a few old faces . br br the knowledge however comes into its own for knowledge boys like myself or their wife's who know what these poor individuals are going through . and find yourself comparing incidents of your own to that of the characters .,1,0
this did for crime what not another teen movie did for school . i laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs warred with each other and among themselves . an unsubtle comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way . i suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30's .,1,0
"i tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch . i was immediately sucked in by the characters . br br robin tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film . her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100 believable . really , this sort of thing is not easy to do . she pulls it off fantastically . br br we know early on this film is going to end tragically , but you cannot take your eyes off of it . the characters do stupid things , but unlike most hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it , these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters . br br this is just a great example of film making imho . great writing , great acting , great directing . a film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment .",1,0
"the very few reviews i could find online of barnens really do not do it justice . i read them all before ordering the dvd , but for some reason i ordered it anyway . i regretted it almost immediately , but the order had already gone through so i couldn't cancel it . i'm very glad now that i couldn't . it's an extraordinary movie . br br i won't give a synopsis of the plot , because other reviewers have already done that . but i will say that i don't understand comments that it's bleak , shocking , weird , clinical , depressing or pornographic . it is certainly very unusual , which i suppose could make it seem weird to some people , but the other criticisms must reflect the reviewers' own issues , because i didn't see any of that in the movie i just watched . i'm not attracted to boys , so the nudity didn't seem pornographic at all to meit's just a kid trying to figure out who he is with no help at all from the irresponsible adults in his life . and it's sweden , not utah , so topless women are no big deal . br br but what surprised me most is how positive the movie is in its depiction of this gutsy lost kid who goes on a sort of odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences , looking forand ultimately findinghimself . it's fascinating , thoroughly original , and deeply satisfying . br br i'm not at all surprised that barnens won three major guldbagge awards , for best film , direction , and actor , but i'm absolutely astounded that the actor who won was not tomas fryk , the kid whose fearless performance as reine must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed , but ingvar hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of stig , reine's mother's sleazy boyfriend . i don't understand that at all , but it doesn't alter the fact that this is a great movie .",1,0

"i'm a petty officer 1st class e6 and have been in the uscg for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard . there were only a few scenes that were far fetched . the most farfetched was when po fischer kutcher went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room . . . that would never happen . swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances . second , the command center supposedly in kodiak , it looked more like a nasa command center . . . we don't have any gear that hitech . third , the captain of the airstation would not be running the search rescue cases with like 10 people on watch . in reality it would be an e6 or e7 as the sar controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist sar controller a radio watchstander . otherwise the movie was dead on , i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search rescue instead of just aviation based rates . some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days .",1,0
"i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago . i enjoyed the film at that time , so i was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since . perhaps it's my memory , but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival . i'm really not sure which version i prefer , but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both . br br let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie . although it's been promoted as a hammer films tribute , people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed . there's some cleavage , but no nudity a staple of the british production house's later movies . and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film , and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt , it's not like any of the company's pictures in tone or execution . this film is very dark , very confusing , and at times very funny . i don't remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one , but that's not a bad thing especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short . and some of ms pitt's rantings are quite entertaining . it's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose . br br the uniqueness of this film doesn't lie with the borrowed details , though . it's in the ideas . as an occasional sci fi channel viewer , i've regularly taken the network to task for its onenote variations on a theme cgi monster kills , then gets destroyed . sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while . br br but don't get me wrong . i'm not complaining . if anything , i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising lowbudget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts . it's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are . but for the rest of us , those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films , the predictability , the lack of respect for the audience , this may just be your ticket .",1,0
"i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie . for instance , the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could hollywood just throw in a token gay character in the movie . and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great . one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top . and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters . for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible . but i guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad . but if you're more openminded and i don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film .",1,0
"legend of dragoon is one of those littleknown games that people either love or hate . some people claim it's far too similar to other games , namely the final fantasy serieswhich is understandable , since it was originally intended to be sony's equivalent of final fantasy . honestly i can't comment on the similarities beyond that , as i'm not very familiar with the ff games . br br i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system . not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form , but every time you attack , you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time . not only that , sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence , which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage . even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of buttonmashing . if you don't want to attack , you can always guard , which not only cuts any damage taken in half , but raises your hit points without the use of healing potions . br br the fmvs are quite welldone , about the same quality as final fantasy 8's . however , the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard . they're nice , but they could have beenand honestly , should have beenbetter . the translation as well leaves something to be desired . not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions , but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldn't have been allowed to pass . br br another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party charactersone dies , and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves . while the death of the one character is often said to have no point , it makes you realize early on that the characters , while heroes , are still just as mortal as the next person . the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats , so the transition game playwise is fairly smooth . perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love interest , shana . she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing , pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration . while you can use her in your party , she is insanely weaki don't even know what her dragoon powers are like , as i disliked her so much i never used her . the character rose , by contrast , is probably my favorite female character in any game ever . she's no wimp , and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful . meru is quite strong as well , while sometimes being an annoying talkative brat . br br the character designers were , as most are , inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever , and didn't give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits . seriously , no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters . but i will give them props , as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries . br br i can't comment much on the plot , as honestly i didn't pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next . i'm not sure if this says something about the plot itself , or my gaming style . br br all in all , it's a very enjoyable game . it has its flaws , but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters .",1,0
"one thing i can say about this movie is well long , very long ! i actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out . i was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because the 70's even though i never lived in them is actually one of my favourite decades , especially for the music ! when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive . i will admitt the animation did impress me ! it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see . but the movie honestly could of been a bit better , it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting . then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly . in my opinion i thought it was extremely long . i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie , it made it seem like it was 4 hours long ! ! ! ! but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those nothing to do days . i will see the new one and i hope it is better !",1,0
"neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist , revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers . but then , nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew , especially one using the gangsterconartist movie framework . as might be expected from luc besson's name on the credits as producer , there's a definite element of 'cinema de look' about it set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap , it looks great , has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style , all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment . but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck , and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life , the universe and everything . if anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences a bit of machiavelli , a dash of godard , a lot of the principles of chess , motifs and techniques , littering the screen with quotes the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims , and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie . rather than a commercial for kabbalism , it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce , chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central somewhat metaphysical con . br br the last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy literally within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger , but it's got a lot going for it all the same . not worth starting a new religion over , but i'm surprised it didn't get a us distributor . maybe they found ray liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary ?",1,0
"remember that friend in college who always insisted you rent the weirdest movie possible ? this is the movie he would have made if he'd had the chance . br br i wish i could tell you exactly what sea of dust was about . it pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the black forest . he goes there to help , but ends up being caught between two young women , both of whom he seems to have a thing for . but that's just scratching the surface . this is the kind of movie where things just randomly happen . . . and not nice thing . people are constantly being whipped and stabbed . there's a pair of creepy little girls who appear to have walked out of the shining . tom savini is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesn't want to be imaginary anymore . he's got a plan to take over the world by sharing jesus suffering . br br on some level , this is a movie about sex . it's one without nudity , which was a disappointment , but there's no mistaking the intent . on another whole level , it's a stoner's paradise . unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected . by the time the doctor travels through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn , you'll just chalk it up to the crazy nature of the flick . br br on the down side , the film is pretty wordy . some of the points are hammered home over and over . if you're watching it with a bunch of stoned friends , this might prove an asset .",1,0

"house of dracula works from the same basic premise as house of frankenstein from the year before ; namely that universal's three most famous monsters ; dracula , frankenstein's monster and the wolf man are appearing in the movie together . naturally , the film is rather messy therefore , but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring . it's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did , as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes . the plot sees count dracula arrive at dr . edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism . then , what can only be described as a coincidence , sees lawrence talbot , a . k . a . the wolf man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction ! it turns out that dracula is on the prowl for edelman's daughter , but talbot really is serious . when it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf , the wolf man throws himself into the sea . . . where he ends up finding frankenstein's monster . br br overall , this film isn't as good as the earlier house of frankenstein . the 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does , as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each universal monster . dracula's plot is the biggest at first , but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end . the wolf man is the star of the show , but his story never really develops , and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in . frankenstein's monster is given the coldest hand , as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought , and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie . the story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting , but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film . the acting is good enough , with john carradine showing his sinister side and lon chaney jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy . glenn strange is given nothing to do , and onslow stevens proves the real highlight as dr edelman . overall , this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of universal horror ; but as silly monster movies go , house of dracula is worth seeing .",1,0
"mike judge's idiocracy is an interesting film , and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see . br br before i start the review , i would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it , definitely do , as it is worth watching , and isn't the easiest film in the world to track down . br br let's start with the premise luke wilson is private joe bauers , an army librarian who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws , making him totally average in every way . this , along with the fact that he has no living relatives , makes him a standout candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure . also frozen with joe is a prostitute named rita who was pimped to the project by upgrayedd , her abusive pimp . unfortunately , a few days after they are frozen , the top secret project is abandoned , and they are forgotten about . br br they wake up in 2505 , and find that with the dumbing down of society following the trends of recent times , everyone on earth is only slightly more intelligent than a chimp . the way that everyman joe bauers talks is seen as being faggy , much as someone speaking like shakespeare would ridiculed now , and a former professional wrestler is the president of the united states actually , this one probably isn't that outrageous really . the best show on tv is called ow ! my balls ! , which admittedly sounds pretty good , and not only is everything spelled wrong , but signs seem to have run out of space for the wording , leaving them to be bunched up at the end . br br it's a funny premise for film , but this is the problem aside from the initial premise , not that much in the movie is truly funny . what i mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself . obviously , it's not terrible , but it probably could have been funnier . br br there are some winners in the script , such as starbucks now offering happy endings , and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood electrolytes , but they are just too few and far between , so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future slurs out a slackjawed , profanity laden sentence with little to no logic andor intelligence , then the laughs might be pretty well spaced . br br it's unfair for everyone to be comparing it to office space , because it's a very different film , but as a film , regardless of what came before it , idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 1520 minutes than in the rest of the film . br br i give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable , but doesn't do enough to raise it above middle of the road .",1,0

"i haven't read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on , but who knows , maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health . it isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health , but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie . you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i've read on one hand , but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire , i get the feeling that she writes really good novels . the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history . br br still , stuart townsend's voiceover narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt's vampire narrative ever did , and you can tell that queen of the damned's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline . while interview decided to go with lace and elegance , queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously . one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places . the costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack . br br however , i'll give credit where credit is due . the soundtrack is excellent . korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead . br br the film opens with a very cool gothrock zoom splice montage , but after the first ten minutes or so , the directing degenerates quickly . it's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice . what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects . unfortunately , queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress . where are the yellow contacts ? where's the pale blue makeup ? scene after scene , i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem's lot and fright night when low budget was done right . br br there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage . props to aaliyah , and may her soul forever rest in peace . she might have become a renowned actress , had her life not been taken from us so prematurely , for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing . did i mention that the soundtrack was good ? let's see , what else can i say ? it wasn't too long . the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it . there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot . but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of secondrate vampire movies out there . the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything . br br jybr br jimboduckdotcom",1,0

"so here's a bit of background on how i came to see this movie . as you probably know , this is the original french film , that was then remade quelle surprise by hollywood as wicker park . well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released , simply because , a i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park , and living in chicago , i didn't see why they called it that it was filmed in fricking canada for a start ! b i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes , done purely because hollywood thinks we're too bone idle to read a few subtitles i am dreading the remake of infernal affairs by the way and c i can't stand josh hartnett , 'nuff said there . br br however , i came across wp on tv the other day , probably about half an hour in , and i have to say initially , it made no sense at all , until about half an hour from the end , when it started coming together . by the end , i was really surprised to find myself really into it , and then the ending just seemed so good a perfect combination of story , passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices i've ever seen heard ? ? . br br since then i've heard a lot about the l'appartement vs . wicker park argument and looking at wp , i still say it has bugger all to do with chicago , but there seemed something about it that i liked , so when it was on again , i watched it again unfortunately , still missing the first chunk i've still yet to see it ! , and i still thought it was pretty good . heck , even josh hartnett seemed good ! but i was curious about l'appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about . so i waited and waited to catch l'appartement somewhere somehow . netflix let me down , so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland . and i've just watched it . br br it's really kind of weird , but a good weird . a classic french film . great acting , romane bohringer is an absolute gem sorry , but she acts monica bellucci off the screen in every scene . vincent cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works . and i've seen jeanphilippe ecoffey in a lot of movies and i just love him the scene where alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his puppy's been run over was excruciating ! but , i can honestly say , having seen wp and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy as about 75 of the rest of the movie had been maybe in a different order , but come on , the scene with the coffee in the glasses ? ? word for word ! ! , you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of l'appartement ! ! i can literally say i was blown away hmm , a bit like poor old lucien was through the cafe window really ! so , be prepared , if you've seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did , do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie , because you'll either be disappointed , or exhilarated at a piece of french movie history a prime example of how you can watch a movie , think you're going to watch a pithy happy ending , and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end . definitely catch this movie . oh and while you're at , maybe not too near the same time , but down the road , take a look at wicker park , it'll surprise you too .",1,0

"when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long , i thought we were in trouble . condensing the gigantic w . somerset maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen . but you know , the movie's not half bad , and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers . br br i've heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet noodle of an actor , and he was , but i can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet noodle , for that's certainly what carey is . howard plays him well , which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly , then finally take him out and buy him a spine . br br ah , and then there's bette , as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him . i didn't know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book , and the movie stays true to that detail . but as played by davis , she does become the most fascinating character in the story , and if she's nasty and unlikable , she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time . davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting , much as brando's would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out stella ! ! in that littleknown tennesee williams play , and it's not hard to see why . davis is intense to the point of scary . she makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience , and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous . her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an std is shocking . of course , it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect ; if it had been made a year later , you can bet things would have been a bit different . br br yes , much of the novel , and many of its most interesting parts , are left on the cutting room floor , and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else . i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of maugham's novel , but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now , so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did . br br grade b",1,0

"after attack of the fifty foot woman with alison hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men , there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than dorothy provine from it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world to play the role . the downsize is that cute and blonde provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into allison hayes' size 50 shoes . this role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal ; provine is more the girl next door type . she may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy , but the material lets her down . lou costello , however , proves he can do a movie without bud abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to gale gordon as his front man for gags . gordon , however , establishes that all he can be is blustery , perturbed and pushy , much the same character he creates later on the lucy show . charles lane also plays the same role in everything he does a straight man , and his screen time is limited . the special effects are convincing for the time , but i would have liked dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous . as the movie's lead character , she takes second billing to costello who is in all of the movie with dorothy several times vanishing like a subplot . the whole movie put together just can't decide if it's supposed to be science fiction , a comedy or just a parody of the allison hayes classic . there's a lot of good scenes , some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film . still , i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women ; there's not enough movies out there like this one . if this movie had a chance to be remade today , i'd highly recommend courtney cox and jason alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely rewrite the original script . courtney tops my lists of actresses who i believe could and should adequately play gorgeous giantesses ; although , i have to admit that if either of the titanic beauties allison or dorothy came after me , i'd go quietly ! !",1,0
"its a shame she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie . she had much more impact than avril , or just about anyone else in the film . she almost made sm look like fun ! she really was believable has the sm model that gets scared of her situation . although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy , those sets were very well built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot . this is one film were both cuts should be made available . it seems they left out a lot of what was shot , and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented . its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming . what was shot would not have gotten a r rating probably a nc17 or x , but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been .",1,0
"i guess i do not have too much to add . i found the comedy to still be funny after more than ten years since it came out . br br the one thing that i did notice was the music during the dialogue to be distracting and often made the movie very hook than it should have been . the use of songs is fine during the movie but the orchestral background is too busy , too contrived and if the movie was ever to be edited for dvd , i would seriously recommend that the background music be toned down to an almost inaudible level . it has cheapened the overall feel for the whole film and i can see subconsciously why a lot of people have passed it up . br br the film had a lot of levels working for it on the script , plot and comedy level . it is too bad that the producer and director felt they needed the musical schlock to enhance the mood . now knowing this , i find it hard to watch and i quietly curse whoever was involved with the musical editing in the film . it had all the subtlety of a jackhammer .",1,0
"okay , let's face it . this is a godawful movie . the plot such as it is is horrible , the acting worse . but the movie was made for one reason and one reason only , like all of those awful mario lanza movies . . . just to hear the voice of the star , in this case pavarotti in his prime . okay , so maybe the lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women , but this movie is about hearing luciano . that alone is worth watching the movie . a big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears , finds humility and love along the way , and belts out a lot of hit numbers , too . br br i must admit i'm prejudiced on a number of levels . i'm italian . i'm a big pavarotti fan is there anything about pavarotti that isn't big , including his fan base ? . and when i first saw this movie i was going out on my own , seeing the height and depth of life's possibilities and in love for the first time . so as awful as this movie is , the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again . br br yes , it's corny and awful . but the voice is immortal and timeless , and the voice is what it's all about . so i give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love , especially since he is now gone . like italian food that you've never tried before , try it ! you may be pleasantly surprised , as a luciano lover or prospective pavarotti peep .",1,0
"i hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time . the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall ! this one was definetely fresh and witty . if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings , only a few women have voted ! i don't want to ruin the movie for you but i'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score , why ? because the movie puts men in their place , that's why . if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men . . . it could easily be a 7 rated movie !",1,0
"okay , sure , this movie is a bit on the hokey side . it's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility dolph lundgren as the punisher , anyone ? , but this tries very hard . i've never read the actual comic book , but that doesn't really matter , i suppose . i judge a film mainly on its merits , not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea . unless its a film based on a true story , that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy . so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating ? because it tries . it tries very hard . in my book , that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film . br br many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus . it seems everybody has their take on vampire lore , be it the cross , the silver , the garlic , the aversion to sunlight , whatever . some of those ideas are included here . the storyline is familiar . . . a group of vampires conspire to take over the world , with one person mainly standing in their way . blade wesley snipes lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses , who have slowly but surely moved into the world , and share it with humankind . for the most part , the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them . the vampires have even taken familiars , people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turned . br br now that i think of it , there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the roddy piper film , they live . a hidden enemy , hidden group of people plotting against them , the fight to save humankind . . . all that is present in blade as well . br br the acting isn't the best here . snipes is , at best , only slightly better than some of his other roles ; n'bushe wright , a relative newcomer , isn't too bad ; kris kristofferson is forgettable as blade's sidekick he's to blade what chip is to the punisher . stephen dorff does the best job of the whole cast here , as the head vampire you just love to hate . br br i don't know , but i just loved the special effects in this film . from the bloodsoaked vampirestyle rave , all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film , the special effects aren't half bad . there's certainly enough blood and gore to go around , but after all , this is a vampire movie , right ? the various shapes and sorts of weaponry blade uses are fairly unique , and not generally used in contemporary action films . snipes has more flair with a deckedout sword than he does with , say , a machine gun . plus , there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away . unless , of course , you are indiana jones . br br overall , this isn't the best action film ever made , but it's not half bad , either . as a bonus , the musical score soundtrack are pretty cool , too . tell me , in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like source direct or photek ? ! br br my rating 810",1,0
"the 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun . sometimes , there were some definite brains behind it all evil dead ii , night of the creeps and return of the living dead for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends . movies like pieces and blood diner stacked rental shelves in the 80's and 90's , offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment . kevin tenney's 1988 movie night of the demons is a part of this traditionstupid , poorly acted and not an original bone in it's body , but dammit if you don't have a good time . br br the plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80's a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20's decide to go to a party at hull house thrown by angela mimi kinkade and suzanne scream queen legend linnea quigley . well , angela and co . decide to throw a sance . this turns out to be as will arnett's arrested development character gob would call it , a huge mistake , because a demonic force soon possesses angela , and starts to get to the others as well . br br take the evil dead , a nightmare on elm street and your average dumb dead teen flick , throw them in a blender , and night of the demons is what you get . the movie is anything but original , and really , it's not a good movie . the whole thing is insanely derivative , the acting is terrible , the jokes often fall flat , the characters are annoying especially the character of stooge and the plot holes are numerous . that out of the way , it's still a lot of fun . so why ? br br well for one thing , the make up and gore effects are top notch , with some really memorable moments especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick that really stick out . it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously , yet with the exception of some terrible puns , plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness . plus , there's a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that's almost impossible to resist . yeah , it's nothing special , but it knows that , and it couldn't be more proud of that fact . it's a goofy party horror movie , and it never pretends to be anything more . br br it might not be a classic , but night of the demons is a good example of horror junk food done right . it might not be too memorable or original , but sometimes you don't want a fancy beer . sometimes you want a budweiser .",1,0
"okay . yes , this was a verytightbudget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together , and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burntout part , and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles . but come on . richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip . steven ford was very likable . mancuso had some great lines , while nancy allen , ironically , was completely bland and uninteresting . classic ? no . bad parts ? yes . entertaining ? big yes . i would have loved to have been onset the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have . are you fast ? . . . y'ain't that fast .",1,0

"take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail . they're not the faces of hollywood extras . somebody in production was really smart to take filming to oxford , mississippi , because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot . scope out the narrow dusty roads , the frozen earth beneath , and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on . no wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving ; they're just reflecting the soil from which they spring . old man lucas hernandez better fear for his life , but then he springs from that same hard earth . br br the movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes and even has some suspense . old man lucas is not very likable . he's a victim and we sympathize , but he's also haughty and unfriendly . wisely , the script refuses to sweeten him up . that way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic . the script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective . instead , we're shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death . so , it's through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed , a much more effective pathway . it also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the jim crow system . br br note how the movie doesn't attack segregation . it's doubtful that old man lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there's no hint that even lawyer stevens brian wants to cross the color line except to see justice done . no , the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid jarman whose head is not yet filled with notions . he's not exactly friends with lucas , but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek . the last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle , the lawyer , instead of his more hidebound parents the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked . the lawyer might not join a future civil rights march , but the kid might . that's the movie's realistically hopeful side . br br there was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief 3 year period , 194951 , the well , no way out , home of the brave , lost boundaries . even famously detached mgm got into the mix with this little gem . unfortunately , the mccarthy purges in hollywood put an end to problem films that might not serve cold war ends . even so , each of these is worth catching up with , not only because they're good movies , but because even with the passage of 60 years and jim crow , they're still relevant .",1,0
"first of all , you should watch this only if you don't mind the lack of subtitles , pornography , kinky sex and utter , horrifying and truly shocking depravity . i mentioned kinky sex , but to call sex in the second half of the movie kinky would be a great understatement . it's more like a punch in the face if you aren't prepared for this sort of sickness . that being said , i can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo snuff genre brought to us by our fellow japanese . br br the plot seems to be fairly basic , almost nonexistent a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie . don't expect much in first 30 40 minutes . there is some dialog if you don't speak japanese it's not going to mean much to you that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew performer , then there is some porn straight sex , and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break . and then . . . it starts to happen . br br it seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene this time tied with the rope . the abuse begins whipping , slapping , hot wax . . . in the end , girl breaks down and cries . they untie her . br br then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened except for the girl . she is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave . she walks to the door , sits on the floor to put her shoes on . . . and that's when hell breaks loose . br br she is hit in the head with the baseball bat , her wound is treated , she is tied to the bed . what ensues can be briefly described i'm not going to spoil everything for you as rape during dismemberment . think of flower of flesh and blood , mix it with porn and you will get the idea . it goes on for about 20 minutes or so . sfx are very good , makeup too . everything is shown , with no mercy for the viewer . you have been warned . br br i thought visitor q was a very sick movie . after watching niku daruma it looked like a fairytale to me . this movie is so sick , so depraved , so twisted , so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to it's finale . too bad it's released only on vhs so there are no subtitles available . but the movie still works without them . so , if you are into ultra sickness , extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre , check this out . i hope you won't have nightmares . 810 .",1,0

"being that i am not a fan of snoop dogg , as an actor , that made me even more anxious to check out this flick . i remember he was interviewed on jay leno , and said that he turned down a role in the bigbudget adam sandler comedy the longest yard to be in this film . so obviously , snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops . i'm not going to overpraise snoop for his performance in the tenants . there are certainly better rapperactors , like mos def , who could've done more with his role . but the point is snoop did a good job . he can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections , but that's something even jack nicholson has a problem doing . the point is i found him convincing in the role , and the tension between him and dylan mcdermott's character captivating . mcdermott , by the way , gives the best performance in the film , though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by snoop's notsosubtle acting . being a big reader and aspiring writer myself , i couldn't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating . it did aggravate me how snoop's character would constantly ask mcdermott to read his work , and berate him for criticizing it . but you know what ? i'm sure a lot of writers are like that . his character was supposed to be flawed , as was mcdermott's , in his own way . my only mild criticism of the film would be its ending . for some reason , it just felt too rushed for me , though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters , rather than plot .",1,0

"one of the better kung fu movies , but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough , with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier which is rarer than you'd think for this era and make the nonfight dialogue sequences passable for a kung fu movie , this is a great compliment . unlike other chinese action movies , which were always period pieces or in the wake of jackie chan's police story i cop dramas , pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately , in the latter 13 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary . br br the action is overall good , featuring a duel between sammo and 12 of the shaw brothers' only 2 stars , karleung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li's bad guy . there's only 20 minutes of combat here , which is standard , but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other , but there are smooth edits and then there's this . it really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with . br br that said , if you like kung fu movies , my opinion here won't dissuade you , and if you don't , you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this .",1,0

"there's nothing much to the story . a young woman steals some money from the dreary vermont supermarket where she works , decides to run away to florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend julie , and encounters an odd couple on the highway . if you remember the elderly couple from rosemary's baby , you have some idea of what these two are like . bill has a comical face and is retired from the army . sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore , although we don't find this out at once . they're affectionate , helpful , and full of common sense . br br they more or less adopt the girl , alice , and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate rv , although they are not driving directly to florida . br br this is where the film could have gone onehundredpercent wrong . all the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil . they would take the virginal alice handcuffed to the bed or whatever and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex . alice would have had a heck of a time escaping , with lots of aborted attempts , before the final shootout . but , no . the couple really is pretty nice , and alice is far from virginal . alice overhears sandra with a customer , asks about the business , and tries to turn a trick on her own . bill prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she's going to do it at all . they don't talk her into it . they guide her . br br alice makes several hundred dollars , which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple . bill and sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it . alice misunderstands . she doesn't find whoring very pleasant work , and she thinks she'll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off , sandra responds with , what ? not here , honey . not in the middle of nowhere . however , after she is talked into handing her gun over to sandra , the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to florida . br br you know what i found the most tragic moment in the film ? it had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery . alice has been expecting to room with her friend julie after she arrives in miami . julie is after all a legitimate student . but when alice calls her friend from someplace in alabama to assure her she's on her way but will be late , julie hesitates and says , well my mother doesn't think you should room with us . and to tell you the truth , my roommate isn't cool on it either . i invited you down , sure , but i thought it was just like a visit for a week or something . go back to milford , alice there is a long silence before alice hangs up . br br only one shot is fired a few white frames of film and no one is hit . tears appear only once . nobody slugs anybody else . no car explodes in a fireball . no cop chases them down the interstate . br br the direction is occasionally clumsy . too much crosscutting between sandra trying to disarm alice and alice's hand holding the wobbling pistol . there is hardly any musical score . there is brief male and female nudity and it's awkward , as it's probably supposed to be . alice isn't unattractive but she is not babalicious either . she sports asiatic eyes , a kind of robust version of molly parker . the cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out . the direction is a straightforward narrative , with a few illuminating flashbacks . nothing is wasted . and it was all evidently shot around danbury , connecticut . the city sticks in my mind because i drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles . br br i don't know exactly what alice found . i dread even thinking that the answer to the riddle is that she found herself . the acting isn't bad at all . judith ivey is better than that . it's definitely worth seeing , a quiet , orderly film that treats the audience like adults .",1,0

"so dark the night poses a tough challenge it's very hard to write about it in any detail without ruining it for those who haven't yet seen it . since it remains quite obscure , that includes just about everybody . the movie will strike those familiar with its director joseph h . lewis' better known titles in the noir cycle gun crazy , the big combo , even my name is julia ross , which in its brevity it resembles as an odd choice . br br for starters , the bucolic french countryside serves as its setting . steven geray , a middleaged detective with the surt in paris , sets out for a vacation in the village of ste . margot or maybe margaux . quite unexpectedly , he finds himself falling in love with the inkeepers' daughter micheline cheirel , even though she's betrothed to a roughhewn local farmer . but the siren song of life in paris is hard to resist , so she agrees to marry him , despite the disparity in their ages , which inevitably becomes the talk of the town . br br but on the night of their engagement party , she fails to return to the inn . soon , a hunchback finds her body by the river . her jealous , jilted lover is the logical suspect , but he , too , is found dead . then anonymous notes threaten more deaths , which come to pass . for the first time in his career , the bereaved geray finds himself stumped . . . . br br a particularly weak script all but does the movie in ; it plays like bad cornell woolrich crossed with the murder of roger ackroyd . but lewis does this creaky vehicle proud . he takes his time near the beginning , but then the story and the storytelling gain momentum alas , just about the time the script breaks an axle . burnett guffey lighted and photographed the film , with an intriguing leitmotif of peering out of and peeping into windows ; there's also an effective score by hugo friedhofer , who supplied aural menace to many noirs . a good deal of talent has been lavished on so dark the night , but at the end it boils down to not much more than a gimmick and not a very good gimmick at that . it's a onetrick pony of a movie . br br",1,0

"well , well . . . . roeg touched a bit of a nerve there , didn't he ? he was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters' descents into psychosis for a couple of decades , but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption or even some good advice might be found in the bad old catholic church , the hipperthanthou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious . worse still , theresa russell's character faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for , is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level that of the spiritual . you know , the realm of the ignorant and superstitious , the sort of thing that the arthouse cinephiles are supposed to be above . oh , the horror . . . so she finds her marriage the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention . people who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives . but they probably won't . sure , this film has some problems , notably talia shire's delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun , 1950sstyle attire and all . and the dialogue between marie davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the spellbound school of glib interpretations though hitchcock's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a freudian psychoanalyst . but , sadly , nicolas roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents .",1,0

"the history of tv to film adaptations are littered with aberrations which almost conclusively prove that the tradition should never have started in the first place . there are , however , some examples which manage to pull it off , just . rising damp would , at first , appear to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment as this hilarious series was based within the tiny confines of a northern bedsit . also the writer , eric chappell , wasn't being paid enough to spend time crafting an entirely original screenplay so he harvested a batch of tv episodes and stitched them together to form the body of the film . this , in itself , didn't necessarily mean that the script would fail . david croft and jimmy perry did the same thing with their screenplay for dad's army and it worked superbly . although , the early dad's army episodes , with their staid pace and over arcing plot , lent themselves far better to film adaptation . the rising damp episodes , however , were high energy affairs from the first scene to the breathless climax . as a result , as one story is concluded and another started , the scenes within the film become disjointed . another pitfall for the movie version of a tv series is the inevitable comparisons that are made . in this respect the film pales in comparison to rising damp's brilliant series . despite all this , rising damp the movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally uproarious . it is perhaps not surprising that the finest moments occur during sequences written specially for the film . this includes a rugby match where rossiter does a brilliantly timed pratfall . indeed , while all the cast handle their roles perfectly bar a sub standard replacement actor for the late and truly great beckinsale , it is leonard rossiter as rigsby that shines the most . in fact rising damp should have been made as a film just so rossiter could have been eligible for an oscar , such is the magnificence of his acting talent . criminally , he wasn't even nominated . ultimately , the film fails to match the giddy heights of the tv series while managing to hold its own as a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments . recommended viewing . br br one last thing the opening and closing music is by far the worst in film history .",1,0

"don't ask me why i love this movie so much . . . maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in , maybe it is the amazing monster effects , maybe because i enjoyed the novel cabal , but it's probably because i love clive barker . i think it's fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you'll probably have a wtf moment at the end . at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons . the studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it . the adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the button facemask decker character . this is a movie about the monsters ! about fantasy ! about a place called midian ! it's a story where the monsters are the good guys . there is truly nothing else out there like it ! it's not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of clive's many great works . sit back and be prepared to be taken to midian where the monsters are .",1,0

"this movie is a ripoff of james cain's novel , the postman always rings twice . apparently , the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this storyperhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties ! despite this , the movie isn't really just an italian version of the hollywood movie . in some ways it's a lot better and in other ways , it is definitely not . br br the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people . in fact , the male and female lovers are a bit ickylooking . the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair particularly on the back and shoulders and his lady love is , to put it frankly , unattractive . they are a very , very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version . and the illfated husband is really , really obese and loves to walk around shirtlessand his counterpart in the american film , cecil kellaway is definitely better looking and probably better looking than the other two italian leads , actually . and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian filmsince i just could not imagine a finely coiffed dish like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellawayi am 100 sure she would have had dozens of better offers ! whereas , the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable . br br part of the italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex . the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway , they never actually get around to sex ! this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic . in addition to the casual sexuality of the film , it's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of lifewith lots of sweaty people , a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath . br br the movie is also pretty fastpaced compared to the overlong american film . and what you get due to brevity isn't all good . the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american filmwith grainier footage , relatively poor orchestration and sets . it sure ain't a pretty film , but the neorealisticlike style makes the film seem more realistic . but it cannot make up for the shortcuts in the plot . many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over . and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american filmand misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats the best part of the american film . br br so which is the better film ? well , a lot of this probably depends on you . as for me , the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitlesbut it packed a great ending . and the italian film was much , much more realisticuntil the crappy ending that seemed too rushed . so neither film is exactly great , but i'd give my nod to the italian one being a bit better . it's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film .",1,0

"i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me , and i couldn't put it down until the end . . . and i had forgotten about my horrid day . and the ending . . . by the way . . . where is the sequel ! ! ! br br the budget is obviously extremely low . . . but . . . look what they did with it ! it reminds me of a play . . . they are basically working with a tent , a 'escape pod' , a few guns , uniforms , camping gear , and a 'scanner' thing . that is it for props . maybe this is even a good thing , forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film , as the centers of the work , instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make cgi fights starwars . br br the cgi is fine . it is not exactly 'seamless' . . . but imho it still works . why ? because there isn't too much of it , and what there is , is not 'taking over' with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot . it prompts the imagination . . . it's some relatively simple stuff , with decent composition especially the heavy freighter shot . . there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds . . . that tracks the entire length of the ship . . . it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past 10 years , to have an action sequence that lasts longer than 0 . 75 seconds , and some relation to the story . it might look old or not 'state of the art' , but it doesn't look stupid and it doesn't take away from the story . br br the acting is good , except the characters die too fast to get to know them . the captain was great , but a few of his scenes could have used another take . i also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse , i like to think captains are calm cool and in control . . . what was going on in that scene ? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment ? did he feel himself losing control ? br br now , as for the plot . . . . mostly it is good . . . why ? because it doesn't try to explain itself . it just happens . it's called 'the planet' , its a mystery , get it ? ? nobody knows why there is a statue , and they don't find out either . the mysterious cult ? the weird scientist with the tattoo ? what do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes ? this isn't war and peace . and , thank god , it's not star warstrek either . no midichlorians , no 5 minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story . the characters are stranded , and are only able to figure out a few basic things . . . it is not a star trek episode where they find out it's leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer . it is mysterious , and i liked that . i don't know why , maybe i can identify with these guys more , since they don't know whats happening , and i don't either . . . they don't talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening . br br in fact , i would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the 'traitor' turns on the crew , and tries to 'explain' the reason for the planet , the cult , etc . this coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog , imho , in the whole movie , and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene . br br ok , sometimes i felt it was a little too mysterious , though . like , why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning ? that was odd . just weird . the 'hamlet' ending . . . again i would have liked to have known some of these characters better . and would it have been so hard to have a 30 second rescue scene at the end ? this is not a serial show , it was a film , and we like closure in films , even if they can have a sequel . imagine hamlet with no 'flights of angels sing thee to thy rest'br br anyways . what can i say . this was well worth the dollar i payed at the 'red box' machine at the supermarket . it was also , imho , a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts 1 2 or 3 . like i said , it sucked me in , wanting to know what was happening , and i couldn't stop watching until the end .",1,0

"honestly , i find this film almost too depressing for my own good . it is very depressing until pretty much the very end . there is no way i can justify passing judgement to any character who did things i didn't like well , except for the disgusting character played by fredrick forrest . but it's still so frustrating to see people behaving this way , putting up walls around themselves when just a word or so could break the ice and promote healing . br br a horrible tragedy strikes a montana family . they believe they've lost one son , but it turns out they've lost 2 . the key is , if they just communicate and face their grief together , they won't end up losing their second son permanently . br br but they just can't . something is blocking this family from sharing their sorrows . some family retreat into silence and resentment while certain others point fingers of blame and then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by seducing the pretty girlfriend of the deceased . . . that andy character truly is a snake ! the only member of the family that isn't threatening arnold in some way is his grandpa wilford brimley . grandpa seems to be able to speak to the boy without judgements or even kid gloves . he seems to know what the child is thinking about even though arnold isn't saying much these days . it is truly a blessing for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to . no one else seems to grasp the fact that arnold might be in shock , in denial , or that his way of grieving may not be the same style , or at the same speed , as they would expect . it's so easy to judge and to be angry and to feel someone is made of stone just because they don't grieve in a way we believe they ought . br br the story is very quiet and naturalistic . you're not going to get some spoonfed narration or some hollywood feelgood resolution . i was very concerned by the fact that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt it necessary to hitchhike several hundred miles to apologize to that piggy andy's wife , for something he should not blame himself for . arnold may have accidentally killed his brother , but nobody is responsible for the end of that marriage , which apparently was a lousy one anyway , except for the two people in the marriage . it's only dumb luck arnold didn't get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer . br br robert duvall and glenn close are frustratingly effective as the parents who somehow cannot find it in themselves to communicate with their son , to find out what arnold is going through . jason presson , whom i've not seen anywhere else except for a childhood favorite called explorers and a creepy ghost story called the lady in white , did an incredible job as arnold , a great performance from a child actor . br br aside from being somewhat slow at times , the stone boy is an excellent , and very depressing movie .",1,0

"some films just simply should not be remade . this is one of them . in and of itself it is not a bad film . but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title . liam neeson was excellent as he always is , and most of the cast holds up , with the exception of owen wilson , who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke . but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects . again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film . but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .",1,0

"let me be the first non australian to comment on this i got the movie for hugo weaving and i watched it to the end . it's one of those drama of life films , as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive . br br i liked the light and the girls . the rest was without too much fault , but without too much merit either . i yearned for something like the interview , or at least some matrix villain element here and there , but nothing out of the ordinary . the story does teach one about facing one's own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you , but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close , so not much of an effort to change things is required . br br the smart american beauty soundalike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack , but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film . br br in the end , i guess it did his job of presenting a part of australian life , but to me it didn't seem specifically australian it could have been placed anywhere and it didn't seem attractive as a story . br br i guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie .",1,0
"i thought how the grinch stole christmas was a pretty good movie . it wasn't horrible , nor was it great , but it was enjoyable to watch . i felt as if jim carrey got a little annoying at times . they made the grinch seem like a special education person , when all he needed to be was evil and devious , but yet he turned out kind of retarded . i did think the scenery , when not inside the grinch's cave , was beautiful , and there was a few parts where i laughed , but most of the time i thought it was just annoying . this movie could've been so much better if they had changed the grinch's personality , and they had included some more laugh scenes , because most of the humor wasn't funny . i liked how the grinch stole christmas anyway , but it's not anything to get excited about seeing .",1,0

"previously , i wrote that i loved titanic , cried at its ending many times over , and i'm a guy in his 60's . i also wondered about why this great movie , which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics , was given only a 7 . 0 rating by imdb . com users . br br well , i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings . while 29 . 0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating , 10 . 7 gave it a 1 rating . these 10 . 7 of these irrational imdb users , in effect , pulled the overall rating down to 7 . 0 . br br in my previous comments , i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings , with a high 10 rating , dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio . believe me , i've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men , mostly , who defame him left and right . they absolutely hate the man , and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic . to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much , and gave it a 5 or a 6 , etc . everyone has , and is entitled to , hisher own taste . but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7 . 0 overall for titanic , pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings , is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture . br br let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more , but these 5 will prove my point . heaven's gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing , and imdb voters' ratings were 23 . 2 10 ratings and 9 . 2 1 ratings overall rating of 6 . 1 . big top peewee 1988 got 4 . 3 10 ratings and 9 . 9 1 ratings overall rating of 4 . 5 . cat people 1982 got 6 . 1 10 ratings and 2 . 6 1 ratings overall rating of 5 . 8 . blind date 1987 got 3 . 0 10 ratings and 2 . 8 1 ratings overall rating of 5 . 3 . jumpin' jack flash 1986 got 4 . 4 10 ratings and 3 . 7 1 ratings overall rating of 5 . 2 . what do all of these films have in common with titanic ? all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower ! ! ! ! than titanic , and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award . again , titanic got 10 . 7 1 ratings ! compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned . br br can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor ? br br",1,0
"ok , at the beginning it looked like shrek the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief . then it evolves into something really compelling , as the gauntlet is set . and the result is an enjoyable movie , which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch manny's past , for example . the premise has been obviously worked for a long time , so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets only ice caps and rocks , and three characters . it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it . as i said , it can be tearjerking at some times , so , kids , be warned . the real letdown is the animation . this wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek , and it shows . the humans are unrealistic , and we have seen better examples of cgi before . but don't let this stain the record as a solo effort , ice age is commendable . and it will gather many fans , i have no doubt . oh and yes , the moments with that small mouse are priceless , and showstealing .",1,0

"as a long time fan of peter o'donnell's greatest creation , i watched this film on dvd with no great hopes of enjoyment ; indeed i expected to be reaching in disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes . but instead i thoroughly enjoyed this production , and i especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the modesty blaise back story . they managed to avoid the trap of making a bad film version of the books we are all so familiar with , choosing instead to concentrate on a period in modesty's life only alluded to in the novels . br br as for the production values and i am no student of cinematography ! yes , the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows . . . but does it spoil the viewer's enjoyment ? in this case i think not . instead we are introduced to one of the world's greatest literary heroines and given a taste of her capabilities . br br in regard to the casting because we in unfamiliar territory the only people who really matter are modesty and perhaps professor lob . for me they were totally credible . alexandra staden , described by some as wooden , and too thin to be an action heroine , brought to the screen modesty's poise and coolness ; her technique when martial arts were needed but most importantly personified the integrity which is at the core of the modesty blaise canon . br br ok , so we all know this film was produced to stake miramax's claim to the modesty blaise character , it was made quickly and cheaply , but . . . i for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers as long as they keep to the core values and characterisations of the original stories !",1,0

"to fight against the death penalty is a just cause . everyone who is sane in europe would think so . in the usa everything is different . the film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving american justice . a young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case . but the film has a sequel . justice in the usa is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance . miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance . one person in the local public attorney offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges . this public attorney's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free . but he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire . he hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance . but he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls . he apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys . one day the local cops follow their intuition , guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl , and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of . they beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and russian roulette . he confesses . sent to death row , he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in massachusetts who is the husband of the local public attorney's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails . it will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice , police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality , some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance . to charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice . the best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention , just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence , which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial , hence easily discardable , with a good lawyer . the film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don't want to make a mistake , which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief americans are supposed to have we hold these truths to be selfevident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . declaration of independence life is an unalienable right that was given to man by his creator , which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away . only god can take the life of a person away . the death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have . even if we do not evoke god , we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance , and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace . if vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty . and there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of happiness but of vengeance . br br dr jacques coulardeau , university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne , university paris 8 saint denis , university paris 12 crteil , cegid",1,0

"while the original 1932 version , with preston foster , was good , there's no remake more worthy than this 1959 one , or more impossible to find anywhere , just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that . never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant , or a script more thoughtprovoking , as well as an improvement upon the original . many years after the last of my several viewings of this film , in 1970 , i read an article in which mickey rooney was recounting a visit he'd made to death row , and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification he'd felt with people in similar circumstances . the article was about as short as the main character here , and didn't cover much , other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized , even in language i would not care to explicitly quote here . . . . . one of my main problems with capital punishment is that , of course , it is not evenly , impartially applied , just as many innocent people are fartoocarelessly , thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate . another problem i have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough , or , for that matter , even publicly enough ! the bible makes a special point , in such cases , about one of the more important purposes of such , as a deterrent , being ineffectually obscured , minus , not only a public viewing , but also the direct participation of all ! as for those who claim to prove , statistically , that such is not an effective deterrent ? in addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data , i have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking . however , i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall , in the apostle , had been punished at all , for his particular crime , or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a temporary insanity defense , as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case . . . . in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit he'd recounted , and about the answers to which i can only try to speculate , i suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature . i don't know exactly when he'd become the professing christian he now makes it a special point , whenever possible , to emphasize that he is ; but , as anybody should be wellaware , this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood , when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye . however , i have no particular bone of contention concerning that , per se , just as there's no doubt , scripturally speaking , that not all , and perhaps not even most , shall be spared the same ultimate fate , at the hands of the lord himself , as a result of his sacrifice on the cross . however , there is a problem , for me , about the spirit or attitude with which most professing christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment ; for , contrary to the lord himself , who would love to see everybody saved ezekiel 1832 ii peter 39 , they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn ! . . . what most people , on either side of this superlatively everburning issue , cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate , is that the lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as he is hard . the two sides of his nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render him mentally deranged , at least by any strictly human reckoning . yet , regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in his nature surely is , there can be no doubt that anything short of it , or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation , falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth . indeed , i've seen the most bloodcurdling thirst for the same come out , selfcontradictorily enough , on fartoomany occasions , whenever the categorically antideath penalty advocates are confronted , even in the most rationally wellbalanced ways , with the fact that , although the lord died for everybody , not all are thereby going to be saved . afterall , in order to receive absolution , one must , to repeat the same term , reach out and receive it , that is , repent luke 1335 . could anything make more sense ? . . . but , then , what about the lord's command to forgive , even in the case of one's enemies , of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation ? one of the fartooprevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality , as popularly misinterpreted , is the way it obscuringly oversimplifies the real meaning of forgiveness . the act of forgiveness does not , in itself , mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven . when one takes a clearly sober , rationally wellbalanced view here , from the perspective of god's own attitude , all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way , seeing the light , and being granted mercy . this attitude is , of course , the very opposite of , say , that of jonah , who actually resented it when god told him that his preaching to the people of nineveh would result in their repentance . jonah didn't want them to repent , but vindictively desired that they be destroyed . how selfrighteously , coldbloodedly like unto most professing christians he was , save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most ! i envy jonah almost as much as he would me ! however , minus the repentance of the one being forgiven , any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine christian is not going to do him any good . in such a case , the only one to benefit is the real christian himself !",1,0

"i would like to start by saying i can only hope that the makers of this movie and it's sister film the intruder directed by the great unheralded stylist auteur that is jopi burnama know in their hearts just how much pleasure they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north eastern town of jarrow . br br from the opening pre credit sequence which manages to drag ever so slightly despite containing a man crashing through a window on a motorbike , the pitiless destruction of a silence lab , the introduction of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anaemic bad guys in movie history and costume design that jean paul gautier would find ott and garish . make no mistake ; this is a truly unique experience . early highlight an explosion get used to it , plenty more where that came from ! followed by a close up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word dad in living memory . and then . . . the theme song . . . br br yeah , this deserves its own paragraph . sung by aj , written by people who really should wish to remain anonymous , it makes the songs written for the rocky films sound like schubert . this is crap 80's hero motivation narcissism at an all time high , with choice lyrics such as its only me and you , its come down to the wire and much talk of having to cross the line it'll make sense in time our hero cares little for the boundaries of bona fida police work abounding . not to mention the indonesian supremes cooing the film's title seductively . at this point anyone wishing to switch off officially has no pulse . br br our hero is semitic cop peter goldson essayed brilliantly by intruder star peter o'brien , the stabilizer of the title . the man's bull in a china shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his less than inconspicuous undercover work truly leaves much to be desired , but he is without question an entertaining guide through the mean streets of downtown jakarta , with local sleaze ball connection captain johnny in tow , as well as peter's own waste of space partner in fashion crime sylvia nash , who does little . so many highlights , so little time the slide please arrogance of peter's not all too convincingly argued case against chief baddie greg rainmaker intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard craig gavin as the monstrous john white helluva name eh ? no ! oh well . . . , the x marks the spot location map stupidity , our hero taking horrible advantage of heroine tina probost during a moment of weakness on her behalf , the latter turning up at a sting operation dressed like a member of a particularly flamboyant dancing troop . and believe me that barely covers it . br br there wasn't even time to go into the plot revolving around the hunt for a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride . or our hero turning up at a funeral dressed as if an extra on boogie nights . or the absolutely hysterical craic between captain johnny and goldson two guys have never made more heavy weather of buddy buddy shtick than these clowns . the trowel was possibly too subtle me thinks . br br ah it tails off people , and you never thought scenes of wanton destruction and general mayhem could be so unbelievably boring , but the character interaction is stupendous , the dialogue truly priceless and the incompetence on show somehow endearing . oh and the shoes people watch out for the shoes !",1,0
"man , i can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie . okay , it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art . but it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun . for starters , the titular pumpkinheaded supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera ; he looks like something you would see in a fourthrate carnival spookhouse . secondly , the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing , with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultraconservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster . then there's the always welcome presence of the everlovely linnea quigley , who's memorably introduced taking a nice , long , utterly gratuitous shower that goes on for two minutes . amazingly , we also have appearances by deceased schlock picture legends john carradine as an evil warlock and cameron mitchell as a horror tv show host . moreover , scream queens brinke stevens and dawn wildsmith have fleeting cameos . lead child actor ryan latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of a moldy old tree stump . pretty brunette rachel carter pops her top and bares her cute little breasts . the cruddy special effects are decidedly less than special . the score is suitably overwrought . yet this film overall has a certain endearingly hokey appeal to it which in turn makes this honey a real delectably cheesy hoot to watch .",1,0

"kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing . recent adapted travesty's like 'intimacy' have ruined great writing . but the mother surpasses all his previous incarnations , eclipsing even my beautiful laundrette . a middleaged woman overcomes widowhood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionallyweak daughter . the fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing . and in daniel craig we have a strutting , brash , gruff antihero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother . beautifully shot , the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters , but as a study of inconceivable lust , it's a winner .",1,0

"over the years , we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what , keeping 8 simple rules going after john ritter died comes to mind , but this is probably the first time i cared . the idea of having that 70's show without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous . they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines , but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore . it just didn't really connect , it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny . the last season felt like the season too much for every single character , simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were . focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working , because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere , and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours . they also brought in the standard cousin oliver , only this time it just wasn't a kid . whenever you heard somebody knock on the door , you started praying it wasn't randy , please let it not be randy . the deal with randy was that he'd do really awful jokes , usually as red would say , smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches . i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused . the problems had started earlier though what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera . everybody started being in love with everybody , emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea , with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching as the world turns . i'm guessing this was character development , but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from family matters . to be fair , the last episode , also because it had a cameo by topher grace a cameo in his own show , was really good , even if not that funny either . br br by the way , yet more criticism on season 8 what the hell was with the opening theme ? not only did they use the same joke twice a character not singing , fez scared the hell out of me . dude , don't open your eyes that far . but the first five seasons or so , among the best comedy ever broadcast .",1,0

"i saw a trailer for this on afro promo , the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring africanamericans . it looked like what it is ; a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay . it would seem that redd foxx's rf wife has left him for his brother , who works with him at the store back in phoenix . he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles . br br so as rf arrives , norman , wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts , gets out of his waterbed to answer the door . trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor , norman tries to wake his lover , who steadfastly refuses to budge . it was just to the point where i wrote why won't he wake up ? when suddenly he does , and me and my friend's jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blueeyed , swirlhairdoed garson , norman's white livein lover , who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from 1976 l . a . he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry , and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch . br br norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit . garson goes to stay with waylon flowers , and madam answers the phone when norman calls . br br so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico . while he is on the phone , garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him . with a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we're about to hear a very special track by the emotions , he realizes that his son is gay . br br his first impulse is i'll kill him . i'll kill him . then rf goes on a long walk , wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have , such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon . his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk , for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man . surprisingly , he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality . this , it must be said , is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought . he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all ! br br rf then hires audrey , a sixfoot amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones . he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality , but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody . br br then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night . he commiserates over the loss of rf's wife , and tells the tale of his own mother , who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because she was molested at a luau . they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam , which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose . once more , mouths were agape . br br so it seems that , wouldn't ya just know it , rf and garson have a wonderful evening together ! you see , staid , traditional older black men just have to see the crappy , highlyeffeminate entertainment of megaqueens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer ! it's really just that simple ! this still does not prevent rf from yelling rape ! when garson wakes him from a bad dream . it ends less predictably than you'd think . br br there was so much that was just off . what is the basis of norman and garson 's relationship ? they don't seem to have any rapport , and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out , and even when he comes around to stand up for himself , he never defends garson or talks about their relationship . there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexualityand sitting right down on the park bench to read them ! i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality , rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends . br br other than that , it's kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era , an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance , we could all learn to love and understand one another ! and because of the whole naivet of this thing , the extreme stereotypes and messageladen dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated , and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years . i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays' female friends are desperately in love with them , and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with , and by extension convert , them . br br hey , check out cinema de merde , my website on bad and cheesy movies with a few good movies thrown in . you can find the url in my email address above .",1,0

barney is about imagination what you guys do not have if my preschooler never wanted to play pretend like they do in that show then i would be worried . what 2 or 3 year old actually gets all that anyways its all about the colors and the singing . for those of you saying that all they do on barney is eat junk food and recommend sesame street better well what about cookie monster thats all he eats but i haven't seen anyone comment that one . i do agree that sesame is a better educational show but barney is just like a show for fun don't be too serious if you didn't like your child watching tv and worried about them understanding things you don't believe then you shouldn't be propping them down in front of the tv in the first place because all of that is fake everything is fake actors are fake so why don't you take your fake brains and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake television show for kids then turn it off and play with them yourselves and teach them what you want them to learn not big bird or bert ernie or barney someone who used to watch all those shows and turned out fine .,1,0

"i'm not sure where to start with this . in short , it was a disappointing movie . having taught the novella , i was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie . the movie has a couple of interesting lines mainly between alfred and aschenbach but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella . br br for one , i was expecting an older aschenbach and a younger tadzio . in the book , tadzio is fourteen , but he is described as pure , ideal , innocent , whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease . he is an accomplice to aschenbach , he always looks back at him , almost provokingly . in the book , it is aschenbach who steals glances at the boy . as for aschenbach , i imagined something closer to the professorturnedclown in the blue angel based on a story by thomas mann's brother heinrich than this fortyyear old with hardly any gray hair . in all fairness , i do think that dirk bogarde did a good job , but either someone else should have done that , or he should have made to look older at the beginning . br br i know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story , but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the apollonian and dyonisian inspirations and focuses instead on aschenbach's obsession of tadzio and does not justify it . i liked the fact that mahler's music was used , because ultimately he did inspire mann to write his story . i'm not sure turning aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move . or the creation of alfred who i don't remember in the book . br br and one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips . i was wondering if it was dubbed because i expected it to be in italian . but then i remembered that each italian movie i have watched has this problem . it just bothers me because these directors fellini is the other person i'm thinking of are supposed to epitomize perfection in italian cinema , and here are their characters laughing without sound , then you hear a noise that doesn't correspond to their faces i'm thinking of the scenes when aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing . this scene couldshould have been the strongest , but it was annoying instead .",1,0

"when i first saw the premiere episode of farscape , i had no idea what to expect . i was immensely impressed and satisfied with premiere . subsequent rewatches , however , have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially . premiere is not a great farscape episode , but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters . br br the episode begins with john crichton ben browder , an astronaut and scientist , preparing to launch into space in the farscape module , a small space ship perfected by crichton and his friend dk . crichton has a revealing conversation with his father , jack crichton , and then begins his test flight in space . of course , everything goes wrong and crichton is shot through a wormhole and winds up in a distant part of the galaxy . br br after exiting the wormhole , crichton's module is pulled on board a living space ship . from here , the characters and story line for the farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner . br br the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode . of course , there is crichton , played well by ben browder . he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with . he's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything . in premiere , crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeepers . he knows nothing at all about either side , but in helping aeryn a captured peacekeeper pilot it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers . he probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for crais , a peacekeeper captain , declaring crichton to be the murderer of his brother . this puts crichton in an interesting situation he's stuck with bizarre , violent escaped prisoners in a faroff galaxy about which he knows nothing at all . crichton's total lack of knowledge of the farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during farscape's first season . br br the supporting cast is just as compelling . there's zhaan , a blue delvian and former prisoner . she's peaceful and reasonable , as opposed to fellow prisoner ka d'argo , a powerful and hardheaded warrior . virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup , allowing her character of zhaan to appear cool and convincing . d'argo's megamakeup , in contrast , is belowpar . he looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose , and there is something peculiar about his eyes . they look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup . farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in season 1 , but the overall costume would , for me at least , remain as a problem until season 2 . br br the puppetdigital characters of rygel and pilot are , to put it simply , excellent . rygel is a tiny hynerian dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft . in premiere he is given some good dialogue but not much else . pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship , moya , and moya's passengers . even in the first episode , pilot gives off the appearance of being a real , living alien ; he never once in the show seems to be a giant , expensive machine . br br the peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well . the peacekeepers are made up of a race called sebaceans , who look just like humans . the chief antagonist is introduced in premiere as captian crais , who believes that crichton killed his brother . in reality , crais's brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with crichton's ship . aeryn sun , a pilot who crichton helps escape , tries to explain that the death was an accident , but crais just claims that she is irreversiby contaminated and refused to change his mind . crais obsession for revenge , warranted or not it should be clear to crais that crichton isn't responsible , is mysterious in premiere , but would be explained later in the season . aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character . by being forced to leave the peacekeepers , she changes her whole way of life , and is in that regard in a similar though less severe situation as crichton . br br the actual episode , as mentioned earlier , feels somewhat rushed and clunky . so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything . also , d'argo for now looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing . still , premiere is solid entertainment . the special effects such as in the starburst sequences are impressive . most of the costumes and the sets on board moya are original . despite its flaws , premiere is a mustsee for farscape fans . 34",1,0

"as shallow as it may sound , i actually delayed my viewing of the barbarians several times just because the vhs cover as well as the picture image displayed here on the website looks so incredibly gay ! by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isn't so much gay . just trashy , cheesy , campy and enormously fun ! it's almost unbelievable that ruggero deodato , director of cannibal holocaust of all people , was the man responsible for this comical cashin on the contemporary popular sword sandal fantasy flicks , particularly schwarzenegger's conan movies . the film opens with a terrific 'onceuponatime' type of offscreen narrator , introducing us to the ragneks . their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers . in other words , the ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks ! their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy kadar kidnaps the ragneks' beautiful queen canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby . meanwhile , and as some sort of amusing waste of time , the two orphan twinbrothers gore and kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and they're unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death . instead of that , however , they escape and develop a plan to free their queen . actually , the plot isn't half as bad as i initially feared , but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers' on screen chemistry , the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasymonsters , like a dragon with adorably cute eyes , some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp . the soundtrack and makeup effects are great and our almighty director deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace . the barbarian brother's acting capacities are much better than i anticipated , apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds . the supportive cast is splendid as well . eva la rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl cara , virginia bryant is indeed bewitching like richard lynch states on several occasions and the lovely sheeba alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donutshaped hair style i kid you not ! . last but not least , the barbarians stars everybody's favorite eyes in the hills creep michael berryman as the appropriately named dirtmaster . i know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the village people , but the barbarians really is a mustsee italian exploitation highlight .",1,0

"in my line of work , i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film . when i can , i take a look at these lowbudget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs . once in a while , though , there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire , as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible . the short film b r o k e n , directed by alex ferrari , is a genuine surprise and worth a second look . br br clocking in at a scant 20 minutes , b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story . the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening . a young woman samantha jane polay awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home . when she awakes , she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book . these nasty guys and girls are larger than life . they are all guns and knives . there is no way out . br br the kicker here is that , despite being a low budget film it doesn't play like one . from the very beginning , the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot , edited , and produced by professionals . it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers . the film is sharp and cool , it looks good and it feels like something big . br br the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films . polay and paul gordon who plays the head killer , duncan were well chosen . as two of the few speaking roles in the film , it is up to them to carry the film . no special effects , no matter how good , would have saved this film from bad acting . thankfully , polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho . some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent , but it hardly shows . br br the downside to b r o k e n is that it's only 20 minutes long . the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle . watching it , i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany , but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be . the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop , but it comes off as unsatisfying . i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film . br br my rating 8 out of 10 .",1,0

"one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was funexciting for the cast and crew ; i could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm dedication because they apparently liked the people involved . br br i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart , and i think this is one such work . the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual , maybe because of some good direction from the lead actressdirector , and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent , watchable piece of art . br br the critiques of this film that more or less say , why not just rent a hardcore porn movie , make the point as to why they didn't like the film . going to this film hoping for a lot of ta without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them . one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie , even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn . i think she graduated . br br in terms of the writing , the dialog is not a huge part of the movie , like in a tarentino film , but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun . particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure , with the villianessheroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings . br br i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this . hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride . br br gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot , not just airhead bimbos , so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art , even with the limits of bmovie land , not disappointing .",1,0
"the brain that wouldn't die was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962 . today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959 ; the thing is both lurid and lewd , but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way . br br the story , of course , concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbsand when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab . with the aid of a few telephone cords , a couple of clamps , and what looks very like a shallow baking pan , he brings her head back to life . but is she grateful ? not hardly . in fact , she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing , particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body . br br as it happens , the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed , and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks , haunting strip joints , visiting body beautiful contests , and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow . but back at the lab , the head has developed a chemicallyinduced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments , this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet . can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance , wreck revenge upon the doctor , and save the woman whose body he hankers for ? could be ! leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of spanish fly ; virginia leith , the unhappy head , screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords . busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music , actors make irrational character changes from line to line , the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot , and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs . on the whole the brain that wouldn't die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie . br br director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip , and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors , who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it . the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost , but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release , and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with . br br now , this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious , depending on your point of view , so it is very hard to give a recommendation . but i'll say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers , you need to snap this one up and now ! four stars for its cheesybizarreness alone ! gft , amazon reviewer",1,0

"honestly , i was expecting to hate this one , and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it . . . but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed . a group of college kids and their teacher go on a field trip to ireland . their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace . the group of postteens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods but being the stupid bmovie characters that they are of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake onebyone . . . first off , there is plenty wrong with evil breed . the actingdialog is pretty weak , and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson , chasey lain , ginger lynn , and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here and jenna's role in this production is grossly overhyped , as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time . even less with chasey , and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever . also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film . those gripes aside there is some good stuff as well . richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on , with greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey's guts hanging out from being torn in half though how she ends up this way isn't shown onscreen . . . not bad for the first 5 minutes . the other kill scenes are pretty inventive , including jenna's forced breast implant removal , a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass , a knife through the face , and a few other notables . the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em , so to speak . also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored . the creature fx are also done competently which definitely helps . overall , evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected . this one , along with satan's little helper have almost renewed my interest in american lowbudget straighttovideo films . i usually steer clear of them as a whole , but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith . evil breed is no masterpiece , but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it i know i was , and i'm sure it didn't hurt the experience . 7 . 510",1,0

"seeing moonstruck after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared . who knew that cher could act ? who had ever heard of olympia dukakis ? nicholas cage was the beginning of his career , and vincent gardenia and danny aiello were not known for their comedic talents , nor was norman jewison the director . br br the only really flat note in this splendid work is when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie , that's amore , a song that is sung too many times in the movie once is already too many and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music . br br cher is forgive me sensational as loretta castorini , a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom . aielo johny cammareri obliges by proposing , offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring , then rushes off to sicily to be with his dying mother . he charges loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother , ronny , attends the wedding . loretta confronts ronny and quickly falls in love with him . meanwhile , her father vincent gardenia is cheating on her mother olympia dukakis , which loretta accidentally discovers when ronny invites her to the metropolitan opera . br br everything works out in the end , as it inevitably does in films of this genre . in the meantime , all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself . in its way , moonstruck is how hollywood used to be at its best rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever . if they'd only lost that's amore along the way , it would have been perfect .",1,0

"i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty 'blood rites' . as blood rites was entirely awful , i really wasn't expecting much from this film ; but actually , it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation . the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites , as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit , and of course ; there is an inheritance at stake . the film is shot in black and white , and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic 'the curious dr humpp' . there's barely any gore on display , and the director seems keener to focus on sex , with themes of incest and hatred seeping through . the acting is typically trashy , but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation , director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing , as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful . the plot is paper thin , and most of the film is filler ; but the music is catchy , and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves , as most are somewhat erotic . overall , this is not a great film ; but it's likely to appeal to the cult fan , and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality 'blood rites' .",1,0
"okay , this wasn't the greatest horror movie i've ever seen in my life . despite the fact that it's lower budget , it's a pretty decent movie , though . the monsters are unique and believable . heck , they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family . although , when you finally do get to see the monsters completely , you really think wtf ! ? those itty bitty things are after them ? ! the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty ! not the kitty , noooooo , why ? seriously though , if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore , this is not the movie for you . go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines . if you have small children , i wouldn't recommend watching this with them though ; probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room .",1,0
"this is probably the greatest war film and certainly one of the greatest films . there's no sentimentality , no patriotic agenda , not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this bleak glimpse of what we can only call hell . it's this quiet rigor and lack of manipulation that give the film its astounding power . there aren't any attempts to make a hero out of ichikawa's protagonist tamura either . he's just a poor doomed sap trying to stay alive in a world of horror who hopes , but isn't sure , he can hang on to his humanity in the process . ichikawa's fierce lack of cant and illusion make fires on the plain stand alone . ichikawa died february 2008 .",1,0
"when we are young , we all pick out an ideal occupation for ourselves artist , actor , writer , rocket scientist , etc . . while most of us grow out of our pipe dreams , the main character of american movie , mark , has yet to let go of hisand at a thirtysomething age too to become a wealthy acclaimed director . despite the fact that murphy's law won't leave mark alone and something always seems to go wrong , mark is able to persevere during each deterring incident with an even greater drive to reach his goals . his desire to be a director so controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to reach the goal . while i noticed other imdb commenters are lambasting mark's selfishness , i think it's an almost justified sortof selfishness because for mark , not becoming a famous director is equivalent to death . he talks incessantly about leaving some kind of mark on the world , and he sees filmmaking as a way to do this . br br unfortunately any viewer of this movie picks up early on the fact that mark has a nearzero chance of ever achieving his dream . is he aware of this ? no , not in the slightest , and none of his family or friends want to let him in on the secretin fact even some of them believe in him . strangely enough though , the disappointing future the viewer feels is sure to occur for mark doesn't impede the ability to find humor in the film . this is a very very funny documentary . most of the laughs come from when mark is filming scenes for coven . there's a scene where an actor has to have his head break a cupboard , and it's just not working . another scene has mark's very old uncle bill saying a few lines to the camera ; needless to say , after 20 takes of a lot of headscratching and linestumbling bill finally decides he's had enough . a lot of humor sadly comes from mark himself . his screenwriting , which he seems to think is worthy of a pulitzer , is laughingly bad it's alright , it's ok , there is something to live for ; jesus told me so . br br american movie is , contrary to what people might think , a documentary that anyone can enjoyeven though my sister , who watched some scenes , seemed to think it was downright bizarre . the fact that chris smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both sadness from mark's depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with billwho unfortunately passed away before the film was released says quite a lot about him . i wonder how the dreamer mark regards this documentary . does he realize that it casts him in a bad light ? or that it sets up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film ? or does he see it as something that will be shown prior to his own ae biography segment ? it's an intriguing subject of wonder , and i hope the latter comes true for him some day . br br i highly recommend this movie 910 .",1,0
"i'm a fan of cc , going back to their records , and liked this movie , but at one point in the mid1980's on cable television in san jose california , it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie . all references to marijuana were replaced with diamonds . the bag that red drops to chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana , but the conversation still remains the same . . . it's worth 3000lb . there is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing cc , and talking to each other about getting the diamonds . at the end , instead of space coke , it's something else . i'm not sure who created this version , but it was horrible , and obvious that they were attempting to make it familychild friendly . it would have been better if that network had not aired it at all .",1,0
"in the 1930s studios would use short films like this one sort of as testing grounds for new actors , given their relative ease of production in comparison with full length feature films , so it's interesting that this one should star shirley temple , who had long since established herself as the most famous child star of all time . then again , she probably wasn't the one being tested , i would imagine that would have been frank coghlan jr . , who played shirley's brother sonny in the movie and delivered a comparatively less impressive performance . then again , a 9yearold shirley temple was probably not an easy act to accompany . br br the film opens with an unimpressive sight gag involving a leaky ceiling , which i suppose was designed to have shirley temple give a scornful look at the ceiling , illustrate the working class status of the family in the movie , and provide a clean transition into the next scene , which features shirley gleefully stomping in the rain . br br it's sonny'y birthday , and his father makes occasional and horrendously botched efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give sonny a dog that he really wants for himself , but sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten by one once and has been creeped out ever since . it's curious that , when his father insists on getting a dog , sonny decides to run away from home rather than have a dog in the house , and as he is running away with no destination in sight , it's also curious that the movie illustrates what seems to be an indifference to homeless people that surpasses even the astounding indifference that exists today . br br sonny passes a man cooking bacon in an iron skillet at the side of the train tracks right after a train flew by which , given how close to the tracks he was , you would think would have blown the guy right off the tracks , but no matter . after sonny gives up on sharing breakfast due to the sour stare that his gleeful smile receives from the guy , he continues on and the homeless guy disappears from the movie . it's interesting to consider what a longer film would have done , because this one leaves this poor guy as a loose end . br br not that that matters , sonny soon hears a dog whining underneath a trestle as he passes over it , and jumps down to find a dog covered in burrs . it might seem trite that he immediately takes the dog up and adopts it since he just left home because of his fear of dogs , but it seemed to me that he just needed to be reminded not of his power over dogs , but of their lack of power over him . as soon as he saw a dog in need he overcame his fear . br br hey , if that's all it takes , all i have to do is find a helpless spider and i'm set ! br br it's a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to , but it's cute enough and enjoyable enough and short enough , as it were to still be a fun movie . we already don't expect an epic plot in a 19minute film , but pardon my pups still packs in a substantial amount of story and character development in its short running time . and it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made charlie chaplin proud . i am hardly an expert of shirley temple's films , but it's not hard to see how she became the most famous child star of all time .",1,0

"three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another . the onehour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over . i have seen other segments of the dekalog but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure . br br the film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder . obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a fullfledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen at least in the short 1hr version of dekalog 5 . we are made to imagine that this must have been the case . a cab driver who is a misanthrope , has two facets to his character the good side feeds a mangy dog , cleans his cab meticulously , picks up dirty rags thrown by people who lack civic sense , and remembers his wife while dying ; the bad side frightens small poodles , refuses to give a ride to a drunkprobably worried that he will puke in the caband ogles at pretty girls . the repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy , drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic , and pushes strangers into urinals without any provocation , is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh . kieslowski's film and the script thus present the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters . br br yet the film is not about capital punishment but more a treatise on killing . the fifth commandment thou shalt not kill is explored theologicallyeven god spared cain . . .

"comanche moon had everything going for it . for starters , simon wincer's back , a man who's name is synonymous with highquality tv westerns . unfortunately , the problems with moon are something even the most talented director couldn't solve a poor script based on a lackluster novel . br br forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you , the biggest travesty in moon is that it's not even consistent with information from the original lonesome dove masterpiece . so many wonderful , rich moments in the miniseries and , to an even greater degree , the book , are completely missing in moon . considering the fact that most viewers of moon are probably coming with at least some sort of dove background , the lack of characterdriven and emotional backstory is downright painful . br br that said , moon is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen . for example , the novel moon focuses largely on the comanches themselves . to its credit , the miniseries tries to service the comanches , but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story . similarly , val kilmer's scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so kilmer and rachel griffiths , for that matter actually had something to do , or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller , supporting parts . instead , kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act . br br there's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book a killer parrot ? what ? further , there isn't a single scene that shows us that call and mccrae are anything near the amazing texas rangers they claim to be . not a single one of their expeditions in moon or dead man's walk , for that matter ends successfully , and call and mccrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another . br br frankly , larry mcmurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script , and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie , brokeback mountain . mcmurtry can write good novels although there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement , but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter . this production would have benefited from not only bringing back director wincer , but original screenwriter bill wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen . witcliff doesn't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit , but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original lonesome dove . with all this said , comanche moon is almost a brilliant production , aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do . steve zahn's portrayal of gus mccrae or rather , his portrayal of robert duvall as gus mccrae is deadon . and while some have criticized karl urban as woodrow call , saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet , stoic woodrow of the original movie , all i can say is blame mcmurtry , because mcmurtry is the one who both in the moon novel and now the miniseries turned woodrow from socially inept , awkward , but natural leader , into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel . br br still , it's the cast that sparkles in moon , to the degree that i left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy i felt watching the original lonesome dove this time because i realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long , long time to come and quite honestly , this cast could have done so well in a wellnurtured , fullblown network tv series . br br all in all , aside from wasted opportunities with the cast , the biggest travesty is that the original lonesome dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating , utterly fascinating , to see translated on screen . unfortunately , all that has been tossed aside in favor of mcmurtry's tedious , inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant , prequel .",1,0
"wow , alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here . wonderful . my name is steve and i run unearthed films . we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america . now before you ask why am i writing a review ? instead ask why some people bash it . i'm writing this review because i love the guinea pig films . why do i love em , it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go . i've seen it all . almost every horror film known to man , argento , fulci , bava , buttgereit . from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster . i've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films . why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place . this review is for the devils experiment . i find it devoid of story which is fine by me . why do i watch horror films ? so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people . the devils experiment not only delivers but that's all it is . pure unadulterated violence . yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold . why do people bash it . cause they like a story , so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story . it make em feel better about themselves . we all want blood and gore . it's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story . the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released . br br i'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world . maybe i shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe i should . my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not . i've always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films . sure it's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place . the devils experiment is not for everybody . it's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only . if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those . but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you . there is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years . they are wrong , disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom , unless she is totally cool . good luck , enjoy and never stop living your life .",1,0

"i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod . if you don't expect anything else , such as clever plot twists and believable character development , you won't be disappointed . consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people , especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy' suzanna arquette , who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten she leaves that up to her daughter . br br mandy's face is a little too perfect , but her body is a complete 5alarm fire , up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness , a perfect 7to10 ratio of waist to hips , and splendidly configured legs , right down to her feet . there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye ; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio . br br and no flat butt to boot , which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres' . mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candlelit hot tub with her blindfolded germanguy victim no . 2 , but from all i could see from her bikini shots , she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it . br br mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl' , with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones . her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no . 2 , who also happened to be her mother's lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise onedimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason . br br mandy's ubernordic facial features coupled with her ubervoluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse . if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress , i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages , especially italian and spanish and maybe french , although i don't know if they would go for her type . but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic , and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground . br br vambo drule .",1,0
"the 1983 bbc production of jane eyre starring zelah clarke and timothy dalton love him has always been and will always be my favorite jane eyre . if you watch any other version of jane eyre without reading the book , it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day . but watching this one almost equals to reading the book . i used to watch these miniseries a lot when i was little , and they inspired me to read the book . at the time i didn't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book . recently , i watched the 1996 version of jane eyre and was very disappointed . it was only 2 hours long and didn't have many important scenes from the book such as my favorite gypsy scene . after that i fell in love with this jane eyre even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story the other versions don't , if you haven't read the book . br br the cast of 1983 jane eyre is excellent . it's true that timothy dalton is a very handsome actor handsome enough to play butler in scarlet , and julius caesar , but he is so great as rochester that i can't imagine anybody else playing this role . and zelah clarke is , without a doubt , the only jane that follows the description of the book . the other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors . jane looks so modest and naive , just as bronte describes her although she doesn't look 18 , but do you actually pay attention to that ? . . . br br some people say that this jane eyre is too long , but i would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version . some say the movie is dull and boring because jane is not passionate enough , or because there are not enough kissing scenes . i hate when they make jane eyre some hollywood movie with inappropriate kissing scenes . you don't have to include crazy , madly in love scenes to show the love between jane and rochester . and both zelah and timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed ! ! i am 19 years old , and many girls of my age refer to this film as boring and oldfashioned . but i can only feel sorry for them because they don't appreciate the purity and beauty of it . after all , the novel is set in 19th century , and that oldfashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book . br br i don't think there will ever be any other version of jane ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one . no matter who plays jane and rochester in other movies , the real jane and rochester for me at least will always be zelah clarke and timothy dalton !",1,0
"it's hard to imagine a director capable of such godawful crap as 'notting hill' pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this , but well , here's the evidence and it's quite compelling . several have alluded to tv drama , and yes , this does have a seventies play for today feel at times , but is always a cut above , mainly i think owing to some quite superlative acting from anne reid and to a fine script which shadowboxes with clich without ever getting one on the nose , except maybe right at the end . i didn't like either the tracking shot of indifferent goodbyes through the hallway , nor the ohwhatabeautifulmorning final scene she deserved a more studied finale than that i think , after all that hard work . the slippers business was a bit ott too , on reflection . br br what i mean about avoiding clich well , i for one had a sinking expectation that the mature man may's daughter tries to set her up with would be cast in 2 dimensions as a repulsive old bore , so as to point the contrast more painfully with the attractive , virile young geezer he is unwittingly competing with . instead , we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo of a lonely , clumsy , not entirely unlikeable and very human fellow , who nevertheless doesn't have much of a clue about entertaining a woman . it was around that point i started to sit up and pay more attention . here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts . almost mike leigh in that respect minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in for . br br and of course i was , as everyone probably was , dumbfounded by what anne reid does with her character and with her body . she's not the repressed , dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time , this is far too simplistic for the character we have . again and again there are allusions to her having been a bad housewife , not to mention that thing she does with trays , trying to look nurturing and comely and only succeeding in looking awkward . the daughter accuses her of having sat in front of the tv all day instead of , well , whatever her motherly duties might be presumed to have been she has no answer . she never was a model wife and mother , at least not to herself that's where a lot of the poignancy comes from , the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to fulfil a role she simply wasn't good at , ever .",1,0

"the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s . considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film , one wonders how it could have been so overlooked . this is a slow , moody , but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family . the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion . the film will not be for all tastes , but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it ok . br br in the early moments of the film , we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they're lucky . while climbing through a barbed wire fence , the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother . these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course . the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows first man climbs through . second man then passes him the gun through the fence . the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence . at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence . br br anyway , once his brother is killed , 12yrold arnold regresses into his own world . he does not even run for help after his brother is shot . he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later . at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all . his family seems to shun him . perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother . an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold , even though the older brother's death allows him to hit on the kid's girlfriend . arnold's parents don't seem to understand how to deal with their son . they really don't even try to talk to him . about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley . after a while , arnold even moves in with the old timer . br br nothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncle's exwife . once he meets her , he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the family's turmoil with the accident . from here on , the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakening . br br the acting is hauntingly distant in most cases . robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents . forrest is good , but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newman's performance in hud . the cinematography is exceptional , too . if you like moody pictures about common folk , this one may be for you . some even may be advised to bring some tissues . 8 of 10 stars . br br the hound .",1,0

"okay , i'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler so i just ticked the box anyway to save the hassle . br br i've noticed that the opinions on this film seem to be a fair split . personally , i loved it , although i must say that i think that some of the cameo's were there for the sake of having a cameo . peter kay ? personally , i am just thankful that it wasn't the edward , tubbs and papa lazarou show , and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to headline the motion picture , especially sir goeff tipps arguably the funniest of the bunch . br br actually , this is less of a summary more of a fairly obtuse bloglike thing , but what the hell , the film was awesome , and i guess that's all that counts .",1,0
"having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons , i believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference . br br though the themes are crusty and stale to today's viewers , it is by no means a crumby waste of time . br br though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse , the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough . br br as noted by another reviewer , it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy , sit back and loaf idly through the film . br br i think this shortbread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it .",1,0
"i caught this film late on a sat night sunday morning with my brother . we had been drinking . this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen . from the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on , roll off' ferry , complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff , then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene this film rocks ! ! the continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it , it slaps you in the face with the holes . in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance . cut to his son and new girlfriend the ships pr director who knows kungfu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way trueon the ferry going very fast away from the explosion . . . . . . . then the dad is there hugging them . how ? ? ? ? who cares , its magic . there is not one redeeming feature to this film . the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table . when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide , you've guessed it . enter the villains who , instead of checking under the one table , proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar a corner bar in the casino fantastic . they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and 'take them out' . br br get some mates over , get a few drinks in , put this film on and howl .",1,0
"here's what i knew about atlantis before watching itbr br it's officially disney's first animated scifi adventure . i'm not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described . br br the preview looked , for the most part , damn cool . evidently , it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact . br br it apparently did so badly that disney said , screw it , let's rerelease 'spy kids' . br br so , with all that said , how is the movie ? br br hellacool . br br i'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway , but atlantis goes all out . it's a throwback to all the cgi eyecandy shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin , so much so that it's almost an effects animator's bestof show . the characters maybe aren't that memorable except , perhaps , for the ship's medical officer , and the plot's a little dull , but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot . br br here's a controversy that bothers me . the failure as in , it only took in , like , fivehundredmillion or something ; i know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc . has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation . i don't think that's true . how do you account for the south park movie ? what about final fantasy ? really , the story and the artistry is everything , not the method . i don't know what disney's comeback movie will be like , but i don't think they're out of the picture yet .",1,0
"i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it , people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance . i really hope norton did not do this . he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie . br br i found it entertaining . it wasn't mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects , but it was not a bad . it was fun to watch . but yea , definitely not a badhorrible movie . br br 710",1,0
"loved the movie . i even liked most of the actors in it . but , for me ms . davis' very poor attempt at an accent , and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch . seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms . davis they would be laughed off the screen . br br i really think she 'phoned this one in' . now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much more . br br i guess i just don't 'get' bette davis . i've always thought of her as an actor that 'plays herself' no matter what role she's in . the possible exception is now voyager . br br i'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful and i hope civil detail how i am totally wrong on this . but , i'll continue to watch the movies she's in because i like the storieswritingsupporting casts , but , i'll always be thinking , of different actresses that could have done a better job .",1,0
"why a good actress like elizabeth berkley stars in this commonplace movie ? ? ? ! ! ! the cast gives some good performance elizabeth berkley as a barbie girl , ele keats as a girl without mother and justin whalin , a guy eternally lessened by his bother , but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original . i can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen ! julie corman the producer are you crazy ? ? ? ! ! !",1,0

"i am quite the mitchell leisen fan so it was a great anticipation that i rented this movie but the print i got was extremely bad , so worn down from use and scorched seemingly beyond repair , the movie was so dark . so dark that in certain scenes that are cinematographed in the dark , you can't see a single thing . that said , i believe i share the same opinion as the first review of this movie . it starts out unusually and does not tote the lines and rhythms of your typical hollywood 30's movie . heck , not even your typical hollywod movie of any era . it seems the director has been influenced by the europeans because there is a certain caustic realism to the proceedings from the opening shot which is so crafted in camera movement and placement as maggie carole lombard and skid fred macmurray meet . you half expect them to start singing make believe from show boat . it starts with a few laughs and poor anthony in a one scene role where he speaks not a word of english gets slapped around by freddie . skids is a bum who doesn't care that he's a bum . that's why he signs up in the army where he can hide from the world . he's just been released though and in a set of screenplay shenanigans , she misses her boat for new york . this is when the movie kicks into high gear and we begin to get those french movie of the sixties vibes to the whole proceedings . the scenes are so well acted by lombard and cecil cunningham , the movie gains a pulse . macmurray is good too as he and lombard fall for each other as she nurtures his talent for the trumpet . then the temptress arrives in the form of dorothy lamour . enough with plot . the movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me . they are very good . and lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half , a bit more is called of freddie and he fails to deliver the goods . with a heavily melodramatic ending and an actor you don't believe , the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure , set design , and direction . it is worth a look . for what is what it was one of the 37 hits of the 193637 season . i don't know its exact rank though .",1,0

"it's said that this film is or was banned in the us since it was released . since there is no information on imdb i must rely on my other sources and believe it . if this is really true , the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway . br br the movie is a socalled mockumentary , although i think the topic is too serious call it like that . it creates a scenario where america is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof . after an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park . in that , they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an american flag , posted 50 miles ahead , while they're are followed by police and army troops . br br the movie itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both the tribunals and the hunting through the desert , filmed by european film crews . all the facts are explained , the interviewers ask questions and film everything . people stare directly into the camera , shouting at it . it seems very , very real . talking about realism here is nonsense . this movie is not about how to make a realistic film , it is about how such a film would look like , if it was real . and it certainly would look like this . if it would be filmed anyway . in an 'utopian' state like this , there surely wouldn't be a european film crew allowed to film those things . br br there are many things that frighten us . the defendants are people from all social classes . political leaders , musicians , authors , philosophists , unemployed , etc . they seem to be hopeless , rebellious or scared . they are no heroes . they talk a lot in the tribunal , knowing it doesn't lead to anything , saying nevertheless all they said in speeches and books and songs before . one says he's not afraid to die . is this true ? well , he doesn't have to run through the desert hunted by cops . the defendants have no chance , or at least , their only chance , the decision between prison and punishment park , is no chance really . the way they decide in the end and the way film ends , makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide . br br these tribunals remind us a lot of tribunals in the third reich . the officials use the same kind of idealistic speeching , ignoring all the arguments from the defendants , starting to scream at them and then telling them they should be quiet . they warn the defendants of watching their language and insult them much more . they ask them questions , the defendants can not answer , but it's never intendend they should . these scenes are a statement about what we call justice . br br the scenes in the desert are on a different level . when we see the prisoners for the first time , we realize that they realize , they haven't got a chance . seeing the desert and the mountains , feeling the sun and the thirst , they don't have a clue how they should stand this free days . the film crew follows them and talks to them while they try to escape this madness . they argue , should they play the game , or escape , or revolt ? it all leads to the same and no one is surprised . some will question if such parks would exist in reality in such a state ? why not ? it empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they want to . it is not a gas chamber , but the nazis killed jews before concentration camps were built . the comparison is fair , since they is no real difference . br br the movie is scary and depressing . the problems that are talked about sound to familiar to ignore . these is not sciencefiction . talking about poverty , unemployment and crime is not utopic . the film shows us that government and democracy as it is presented to us , is not only useless , but dangerous . it also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution . the defendants seem to be confused because they don't really know how to fight this . they do things , but for nothing . even is this delivers no solution to us , it still is a statement . br br to me , the most frightening thing is the fact of the banning of this movie . here we have a film that accuses the loss of freedom , moral and peace . it accuses the government , a fictional goverment nevertheless , to be dangerous and inhuman . and such a film is banned . think about it when you see the american flag the next time .",1,0
"this movie has to be my favorite of all time . its not supposed to have a plot , because its makers wanted people charlie sheen , i thinkto believe it was a real snuff film . this was an exercise in visual effects , and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does . movies these days are now all about sound effects , leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood . there still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing . there is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film . have you seen the hills have eyes 2 ? the rape scene was funny instead of shocking . although i'm sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror . but since they probably suck at making films , they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off . the movie baise moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks . br br its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all , especially when talking about an ao or nc17 rating . i'm sure eli roth has the abilitytalent to make his hostel film series much much better , but he has too tame it down to get an r rating . . . or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations . br br watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident crime scenesfootage . don't forget that this movie was made in 1985 . the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film . that would be like someone saying the 8bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps3 has better graphics .",1,0

"go way back to page ten of this review section , and work your way back up . go ahead ; i'll wait . br br done ? well , then you've probably noticed the same trend that i have . you could nitpick all day long about the lame jokes , dated timing and obviously derivative plot points and shtick in 'bogus' , but this movie seems to be one of those 'hate me now , love me later flicks . br br bill and ted's biggest problem was that the original appealed to those 80's kids who followed the tends and considered themselves on the cutting edge of fashion . that worked fine for the original , but obviously bombed in 1991 , when no selfunrespecting slacker would be caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting he liked anything about the 80's . as ted would put it dude , this is a totally deep hole . wanna play 20 questions ? br br they say nostalgia goes in 20 year cycles , and that certainly seems to be the case here . here in 2010 , those of use who grew up with cindi lauper and megadeth are beginning to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that like it or not made us who we are . if you're one of those who look at 'bogus' as if it were an outdated fa gs ! ripoff , then you're missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair , wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed . br br in selfreferencing its own origins the star trek episode and and time traveling with a phone booth , bt makes no attempt to hide its creators' love for homage . quentin tarantino , anyone ? i'm not saying 'bogus' is 'true love , ' but i do think it needs to be appreciated for what it is a fun snapshot of our society at a time before child psychology , ritalin , antismoking ads , terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media fearmongering . br br so , for all of you bt haters out there . . . turn off your screaming trees cd , get that hair out of your face , go to the beach and lighten up . narcissistic depression and intellectual ennui are so corporate .",1,0

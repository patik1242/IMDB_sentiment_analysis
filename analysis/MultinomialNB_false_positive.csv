"i disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the british . the film effectively blames the people of ni as being the cause of their own troubles . it suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with britain's partition of ireland and domination of its history i . e . ni was created by britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of ireland . the characters are portrayed as hapless fools , even though i despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause maintaining their artificial privileges over the catholic community . it is a known fact that british intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war , no doubt to keep the catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism . nineties' values about 'machismo' , masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique irish 'psyche' which leads to violence . the stupid song from the woman in the club old ireland of green fields . blah . blah . is given a symbolic stature , i . e . poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause . tedious , ahistorical , cheap and nasty trash . o'sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis .",0,1
"the motion picture was , in all likelihood , made in the year 1930 and released in 1931 . i would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era . nevertheless , this particular zane grey plot appears to be very weak . also , gary cooper was probably just learning to act . the result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards . for 1931 , maybe . for 2004 , not acceptable . some of the actors performed well . sadly , the indians always get the short end in these early westerns . they were living on the land long before the white man came , but according to twisted history , they had no right to defend themselves .",0,1
"lynn hollister , a small town lawyer , travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend johnny . yes , lynn is a man despite the feminine sounding christian name . were the scriptwriters trying to make a snide reference to the fact that john wayne's birth name was marion ? hollister at first believes johnny's death to have been an accident , but soon realises that johnny was murdered . further investigations reveal a web of corruption , criminality and election rigging connected to boss cameron , the leading light in city 's political machine . that sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller , possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in 1941 . it isn't . a man betrayed , despite its theme , is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama . hollister falls in love with cameron's attractive daughter sabra , and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements . this film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama . one reviewer states that john wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer , but he couldn't play a cowboy in every movie , and a tough crusading lawyer taking on the forces of organised crime would probably have been well within his compass . where i do agree with that reviewer is when he says that wayne was no cary grant impersonator . romantic comedy just wasn't up his street . one of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses demanded of them , regardless of whether it was up their street or not , and as wayne was one of the few major stars working for republic pictures they doubtless wanted to get as much mileage out of him as they could . that said , not even cary grant himself could have made a man betrayed work as a comedy . that's not a reflection on his comic talents ; it's a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film . i doubt if anyone , no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be , could find anything to laugh at in it . the film's light hearted tone doesn't make it a successful comedy ; it just prevents it from being taken seriously as anything else . this is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring . 3 10",0,1

"you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates a . k . a . reads the script plot synopsis over his character's funeral procession , a mere 5 minutes into the movie . the narration is his character's last will testament . it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his 4 children and servants . the children shall split 136 million equally , but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders . if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants . to be eligible , they must live in the family estate for a week . it sounds like the typical plot of a reality show . there is little subtext as to the nature of the deans . they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family , but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog . from the opening voice over by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending . that journey is painfully slow and pointless . we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around , playing pool , throwing darts , the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot , dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men , constant bickering , misplaced circus music , bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux german expressionism , the horror aesthetic of the 4th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting . this all inevitably leads to the expected ungratifying ending . you will be happy to still be alive , but the pain might be too great to bear alone . share children , share . celluloid rehab",0,1

"there is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this . i remember feeling the same way after disliking dogma . if you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like mulholland dr . , you are seen as not getting it . of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway . i have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream like quality it has . in other words , the plot isn't structured like other films . with the case of mulholland dr . , it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project . it doesn't make sense , it isn't supposed to , but i know it was to be a tv series at first . it appears lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff . you will notice that toward the end the nudity , sex and foul language increase . all things he would not have filmed for television . for a better film not told in a traditional , linear fashion , rent the thin red line from 1998 . that was a great film , this is not . rating 2 out of ten",0,1

"italian horror suspense film about a wealthy english lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife evelyn . you know he must have really loved his wife , because he brings them to his home a huge , rotting castle and makes them disrobe and then tortures them , whips them , and kills them . the most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film's end , we see this guy played by antonio de teffe as the hero of the film . anyway , soon , under the advice of his playboy uncle roberto maldera , de teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle's party . she moves in and strange things begin to happen to de teffe's fragile state of mind . he begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally , well , just look at the title if you are still curious . also , family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions . poor aunt agatha she looks like she might even be younger than de teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old meets her fate in a foxy fashion . another man is injected and then buried alive . and of course , there is a whole explanation as to why how evelyn did what she did . director emilio miraglia does do some things fairly well the settings in the film are well suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is england is ludicrous at best . none of the actors look english . many having dark black hair and mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an englishman wouldn't be caught dead in . the cars drive on their wrong side of the road . but all that notwithstanding , the crypt scene was effectively shot and i liked the cheesy resolution too . and of course any film with the sultry , red headed erika blanc is always a plus . there is a streak of sexual perversion ; however , which i found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons . c'mon .",0,1
"the story is very trustworthy and powerful . the technical side of the movie is quite fine . even the directing of it . the main problem is with the castings , that turned that movie into almost another local and regular clich with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression . beside the small role of the father , rafael played impressively by asi dayan , all other actors were unfortunately not in their best . the role of the elder blind girl , played by taly sharon , was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role . therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile . there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie . but after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future .",0,1
"this movie is not that interesting , except for the first ten minutes . the pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece , even better than say gosford park . then it inexplicably slows down , loses focus and starts resembling a traditional french movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between antoine depardieu and c cile deneuve . in the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story , several threads started are not ended . spoilers ahead the main story is the relation between antoine and c cile . he has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago , despite her remarrying and setting up home in morocco . as builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of c cile's marriage . having accomplished this , he is buried after a freak accident literally and becomes a comatose . he wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they've reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together . end of spoilers it remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here illegal immigrants want to enter europe , there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of iraq's former regime . c cile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs loyalty once he meets his boyfriend , whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick of that ? . her sister is traditional islamic , and enters a relation with c cile's husband . it portrays morocco as unnecessary backward , despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past . it portrays islam as backward and prone to extremism , which may sometimes be true , but certainly not in general . in the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art . deneuve and depardieu are great . with this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene lifting an eyebrow , body language , radiating pride , awkward behavior . the movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of french cinema in the world nowadays . with some notable exceptions of course .",0,1
"john wayne albert dekker compete for oil rights on indian territory , and for the attention of martha scott in this republic pictures film shot out of utah , usa . an interesting western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting , with wayne dekker playing the old and new factions of the west . it's based on a story by thomson burtis who co writes the script along with eleanore griffin and ethel hill . albert rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career . a pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third , where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse . the light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesn't sit quite right , and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work . but hey , stunt men deserve their moment of glory always . solid support comes from george 'gabby' hayes and wayne as usual has much screen charisma , particularly when rattling off his pistol . but in spite of its better than usual republic budget , it remains a film of interest only to 1940s wayne enthusiasts . 4 10",0,1

"before the days of home video , stan laurel's pre hardy comedy 'kill or cure' was known to the extent that it was known at all only because a few sequences were included in robert youngson's compilation film 'laurel and hardy's laughing 20's' . youngson knew what he was doing the best gags in 'kill or cure' were brought intact into his compilation , while the rest of this only mildly funny comedy remained on youngson's cutting room floor . laurel portrays a commercial traveller , hawking a patent medicine cried professor i . o . dine's knox all that name is the funniest joke in this movie , which ain't sayin' much . i should point out that this movie dates from 1923 , the shank of prohibition . during prohibition , quite a lot of americans purchased patent medicine if it had ahem ! 'medicinal' properties , so if knox all contains alcohol stan's job in this movie is less desperate than the one which he and ollie famously had in 'big business' , selling christmas trees in the summer . too bad for this movie that it's not nearly so funny as 'big business' . we see stan but don't hear him , in this silent film delivering a spirited sales talk to a man who seems to be paying attention . until we learn that they're standing outside a deaf mute institution , and this man is deaf . a haughty woman emerges from the gates stan quickly tries to engage her attention by wiggling his fingers at her . of course she's not deaf , and she promptly whacks him with her umbrella . i found this sequence offensive , not because it involves deaf people the deaf aren't the butt of the joke but because it abets the very widely held misconception among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf by merely waggling their fingers randomly and performing charades without actually learning the highly complex grammar of sign language . more amusingly , a spinster in this movie has a pet canary named rudolph as in valentino , and there's a gag involving trick photography to enable a man to hide behind an object that's narrower than his body . i've seen this device in several cartoons and live action movies but 'kill or cure' is , i think , the earliest movie to use it that i've seen so far . stan laurel , an under rated actor , does one bit of physical business here that's worthy of chaplin or keaton , in which he conveys his emotions and a change in his demeanour while walking away from the camera with his back to us . still , laurel never really became a first rate comedian until he united with oliver hardy to form the greatest comedy team ever .

"! possible spoiler ! you d think a story involving archie grey owl an englishman posing as a red indian would have a massive amount of humour involved . in fact i d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama . worse , he s made an extremely dire film too . pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and pony played by the equally wooden annie gaupeau lacks any type of on screen chemistry . but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he s a native american . the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of archie being an englishman that s why i wrote possible spoiler it s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is english , but it s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there s absolutely no surprise involved . yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn t actually a new concept . theodore roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message that there hasn t actually been a great ecological film . in fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes grey owl , a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor",0,1

"question how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration ? answer by turning it into an existential alienation parable . yes , we're back in the early 90s , just after the disintegration of the eastern block and the subsequent flooding of immigrants in the european union , and what better way to deal with the subject than making a film about an existentially alienated middle class journalist , an existentially alienated upper class politician , his existentially alienated rich wife , and so on . in the background , immigrants are asking for political asylum in an unnamed greek village near the borders . i guess that way angelopoulos can show some social awareness , while dealing with the existentially troubled upper classes . i mean honestly , the scene where some top ranking army officer curses his destiny cause he sent his daughter to study in london is enough to make you puke . anyway , it can't be that bad , angelopoulos is a master of the cinematic art after all , right ? wrong . it's at this point when his mannerisms start getting too artificial , sort of like a filtered image in photoshop . his usual tricks show up there are blurred windows , blurred lights , a weird wedding , a walk by the river shore , and people with yellow water coats . also mastroianni breaks new ground for most sleepwalking performance ever . avoid really . go for his early films .",0,1

"i totally agree with the review by a reviewer of variety that the film is never quite as funny , lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant . narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic . if the film is supposed to be character driven the poor lighting doesn't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors . many non south africans will have difficulty in following the spoken english in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process . i watched the film at the cape town world cinema festival last year . comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past . unfortunately bunny chow won't be remembered as one of the bright lights of the south african new wave , but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history . not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in cape town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in durban and gauteng . it has clearly limited appeal among south african audiences .",0,1
"shintar katsu gained tons of fame playing the wonderful character , zatoichi . the zatoichi films had a weird and unbelievable concept a blind guy is the greatest swordsman in japan and spends each movie righting wrongs and exacting retribution on evil doers . he's a heck of a nice guy and the films are exciting and addictive i've actually seen every movie . it is because of this i saw this final installment of the hanzo the razor series , as i assumed it would be very similar . and boy was i wrong ! it turns out that the hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and they also promote the rape of women who deserve it . you see , hanzo is a policeman from the meiji period and he regularly takes evil women into custody and interrogates them by violently raping them with his penis of steel . how he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe , but it certainly is not for the squeamish . overall , i just can't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films . however , from looking at the other reviews , i can see that they are still very popular . and that is pretty scary . despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes , the films just are like brain pollution and i'd hate to imagine how the films might have contributed to violence towards women .",0,1
"the last station , director michael hoffman's melodrama about the last months in the life of leo tolstoy , begins with fog and sleep . tolstoy christopher plummer lives with his family in a compound at yasnaya polyana , taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his movement , people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism , vegetarianism , sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away . his wife , sophia helen mirren wars openly with the head of his movement chertkov paul giamatti , who she claims in his efforts to convince tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death . observing all of this is tolstoy's new steward , bulgakov james mcavoy , a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife . hoffman's script , which is based on the novel by jay parini , quite often veers itself into confused territory , building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately don't resolve themselves in any satisfying way . the scope of the film is grand , and its story should reverberate just as tolstoy , whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the bolsheviks' and those of pacifists like ghandi . it unfortunately doesn't , it's un unpickable , building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness . the three way relationship between the church , the faithful sophia and the unbelieving tolstoy , for example , is referenced often . in the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up , but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy . there are a ton of details in the film , but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered , overburdened , energetic but unfortunately pointless . at its heart is the love story between sophia and tolstoy , and that story , as baffling and cramped as it is , is the reason to watch the film . mirren and plummer are , unsurprisingly , the best things in the film . plummer's tolstoy is vague , at once confused and resolute , apprehensive and full of joy and certainty . mirren's sophia is in full panic , in a righteous lather , forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time , his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas . they're great performances , all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couple's place in history and the script's ability to support that , both sophia and tolstoy seem willed into the film by mirren and plummer alone , both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there . giammati and mcavoy , both talented actors , are unable to do the same and giamatti's chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief and not both at once , either but rather a cipher , a stand in for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses . the scope of this thing never boils down to anything , it hitches along , getting by on the strength of plummer and mirren and not much else . it's interesting and pretty , but ultimately unrewarding . 4 . 5 10",0,1

"beware , my lovely 1952 dir harry horner production the filmmakers rko radio pictures credulity straining thriller from the pioneering producer team of collier young and ida lupino , aka the filmmakers with lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction . robert ryan is the 'peril' and ida lupino is the 'woman' in this entry in the 'woman in peril' style film . ryan plays howard wilton , a tightly wound psychotic handyman drifter noooo , ryan ? i know , hard to believe . lupino is the lonely war widow , helen gordon , who hires howard to do some work around her house . things go downhill from there as howard makes helen a prisoner in her own home . howard has a nasty secret , not that he could reveal it . you see , consciousness is a real challenge for him . maintaining it , that is . he has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead . this is part of the film's problem . the nature of howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that he's been free to roam from town to town unobstructed , even in the year 1918 when the film is set . he can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago . his violent , threatening , anti social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things a young girl flirting , inadequacies involving the war , due to his being rejected for service . i don't know how he even made it past the interview with helen . there are other implausibilities . if you were locked in your house with a madman , but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time , couldn't you figure out a way to escape ? ryan , i think , is defeated by the material . it feels like he's overplaying his hand . his series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of dementia all have a been there , done that robotic feel to them . at this point in his career he'd probably played this character , to some degree , ten times and it shows . we are encouraged to empathize with howard i didn't through shown bits of humanity , like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who won't judge him . lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress , which she is more than capable of and does . the picture had one thing going for it ; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict ? so naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective . of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch howard's reflection in mirrors , water , christmas tree decorations . this indicated something going on , or about to go on , in his head . horner 1953's vicki , who made his reputation in production design , does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison . credit too , the always reliable rko art department for the work on the house . in the end , sub standard work from the principals , who all have much better films to their credit . out of 4",0,1
"every once in a while , an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can't miss , but the movie sucks . some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are levity and the safety of objects , and now here's the united states of leland . said awesome cast includes ryan gosling , kevin spacey , don cheadle , jena malone , lena olin , michelle williams , chris klein , and kerry washington . gosling plays leland p . fitzgerald , the teenage son of a famous author spacey who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime murdering a retarded child , but doesn't remember it and doesn't seem to have any sort of motive . don cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand leland and also exploit him by writing a book about him , and jena malone is his ex girlfriend . we see their deteriorating relationship due to her heroin addiction in flashback . sounds like an awesome little drama , huh ? i thought so , too . the fact is that this movie is just badly , badly written . the dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating platitudes about life , the characters are all two dimensional indie cliches , and while it does manage to make leland sympathetic in some ways , it glosses over his crime . for the most part , there's no problem with the acting . gosling who was oscar worthy in the believer is a tremendously talented young actor , but the way they're written , none of these characters least of all leland even feel like real people , so there's not much he can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad . jena malone is the most memorable . she has one of the most expressive faces i've ever seen . even playing an underwritten character in a bad movie like this , she can break your heart with one look . when she's got good material to work with as in donnie darko or the dangerous lives of altar boys , she's really amazing . but this is not good material . maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile , but as it is , the united states of leland is ponderous , inert , and for a movie that seems in love with how deep it is , it's really shallow .",0,1

"chaplin was great a silent comedian , but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies . in my opinion , chaplin's voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous . his career never recovered when sound came to film . contrary to most of the reviews i have read , chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by chaplin the comedian , and not spend their entertainment dollar watching chaplin's political commentary . despite chaplin's awards and knighthood , i would take exception to his contributions to humanity . the great dictator was made at the same time stalin's brutal dictatorship was having it's show trials , and both dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of poland by both dictators . wwii started in an attempt to save poland . the nazi's were defeated in 6 years , but poland disappeared as a sovereign country . this happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of hollywood by the federal government . had chaplin included joe stalin in this satire , in addition to including the italian dictator , perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians . the soviet's mistreatment of jews and dissidents exceeded the nazi's in time and numbers . judged simply as a film , many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers , who wouldn't know who goebbels , goring or mussolini were . a classic piece of art must stand the test of time . classic greek tragedy , the mona lisa and beethoven's 9th are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless . films which rely on topical political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not outlast the generation in which they are made . but those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me . chaplin , as the writer , director and lead actor must take the blame for what i judge as a dated and tiresome film . chaplin's apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous . if chaplin found the us so offensive , why didn't he return to his native land . great britian fought the nazi'with blood and money . what did switzerland contribute in the fight against the european dictators ? switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class , and cares little about people who can't join the club .",0,1
"creakiness and atmosphere this film has , but so unfortunately does the print i just viewed . raymond massey provides a laid back sherlock holmes , almost comically so in early scenes in his bathrobe , which he trades in for a laborer's garb to investigate the creepy mansion of dr . rylott lyn harding . what wasn't clear to me was why rylott would have wanted his stepdaughters dead . if as in the case of helen angela baddeley , he didn't want her to run off to get married , he would have accomplished the same thing by having her dispatched . other curiosities abound as well . after setting an early wedding date with helen , the fianc e is no longer heard from for the rest of the picture . the presence of a band of gypsies at the time of violet stoner's death provides merely a diversion , and what could have been an interesting murder tool , a poisonous snake , is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra , the musical renderings of the indian man servant notwithstanding . athole stewart competently portrays holmes' aide dr . watson , though he takes some getting used to if nigel bruce is more your cup of tea . as rylott , lyn harding is sufficiently menacing , a trait that would be put to good use as holmes' nemesis professor moriarty in two later films 1935's the triumph of sherlock holmes and 1937's murder at the baskervilles . with repeated choppiness and an unsteady camera , it's surprising that the story line isn't more disrupted than it is . it's integrity is generally maintained , even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps . i guess that would be my main complaint with the film , as mentally bridging some of the jump cuts in the picture proved to be a real pain in the asp .",0,1

"i am a shakespeare lover since childhood . i am also a jew . merchant of venice is anti semitic through and through no matter how hard scholars and literature lovers try to re interpret it . in the play , shylock is portrayed as demonic and cold hearted and has no forgiveness , no warmth , no love except for money and cruel revenge , whereas the christians are kind , moral people . his motives in the play revolve around money he plots revenge from the start based on damage caused to his business as well as blind racial hate , not noble ideals or hurt racial pride as this movie wants you to believe . and this characterization is given to him by shakespeare himself , not by the other characters . as final proof , the happy ending is where the jew loses his money and is forced to convert to christianity . i acknowledge this and move on . it is part of history and i enjoy shakepeare despite this fact . therefore i expect a movie based on this play to play it straight . i would much rather see the work adapted for its rich language and storytelling without any whitewashing . but many of the the bard's artful subtleties and playful characters are lost in this movie . for example , in the last scene where the men discover portia's undercover work as a man who also took away their rings , instead of the playful game of words and misunderstandings as the truth reveals itself , it becomes a mean spirited game where two bitchy women play cruelly with their soon to be husbands . so instead , we are only left with lovely detailed sets , fragments of the rich language with poor reinterpretation , poor casting , one intense courtroom scene , and a controversy . the truth is , i think it would be much easier to identify the anti semitism in the story and move on if it were left as is . despite all the whitewashing the makers of this movie pulled out of their hats , there is plenty of hatred left , only now people can make excuses and pretend the portrayal of jews isn't so bad anymore . and finally , another problem is with most of the actors being miscast . pacino is way out of his league and is very uncomfortable with the language , not to mention the horribly fake accent . fiennes as bassanio is charmless and awkward with the language . irons is dependable as always but doesn't do much with his role . portia is somewhat ok but unlikeable , and covered in bad makeup , just like the movie .",0,1

"the lifetime channel aired this in october but i only got around to watching it now . it's the old eternal triangle again small town connecticut boy dave ford matt long has a quick fling with his best friend's girlfriend , emily darrow emmanuelle chriqui , on the eve of his departure for law school in new york , thinks about her for the next five years while he isn't doing contracts and briefs , runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later , and gets involved with her romantically again . but director and co writer matthew cole weiss goes way over the top , framing the whole thing in flashback as dave confesses to murdering emily , her husband and another one of her lovers in front of here comes the spoiler a lesbian cop who's also a flame of emily's . weiss overdoes the flanging effect by which dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he's actually dead , cutting those in even while dave and emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal . i couldn't help but flash back myself to james m . cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers all adapted into hit movies the postman always rings twice , double indemnity and mildred pierce . it also doesn't help that the film ends with the bad guys the bad girls , actually triumphant and the decent , if na ve and stupid , hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table or that the actors playing the people dave and emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are . incidentally , though this film went straight to cable in the u . s . there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped , so i presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world .",0,1
"an art house maven's dream . overrated , overpraised , overdone ; a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve best picture of 1951 on its own merits , it was dwarfed by the competition from the start . place in the sun , detective story , streetcar named desire , abbott and costello meet the invisible man ; you name it , if it came out in '51 , it's better than this arthouse crapola . the closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd , out of place and in the wrong movie . few actors in their time were less capable at acting or less charismatic than kelly and caron . my 12 worst of '51 i saw 201 movies , and among the 5 worst best picture oscar winners .",0,1
"this film is another of director tim burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his vision' to the screen . he has done it with batman' , sleepy hollow' and now this . this is not a remake . the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak and charleton heston makes a cameo . burton has reconstituted the entire story , watering it down for today's mass viewership . the original planet of the apes was a product of its time . during the 1960's america was struggling to redefine its civilization . it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms . it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal . in that context , pota was allegorical , reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day . pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior . the dialectic between colonel taylor charleton heston , dr . cornelius roddy mcdowall and dr . zira kim hunter was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious . burton's version is as much a product of today's times as pota was of the sixties . this is apes for dummies . it is superficial and jejune , substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance . the surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel . while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene , burton's ending simply mocks the audience , taunting , i know something you don't know , and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out . ' from a technical perspective , as is always the case with burton's film , the film is excellent . the makeup is fantastic and burton's camerawork is outstanding though i continue to dislike his dark look . however , thirty three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script . the story has been reduced to a monster movie . the humans band together behind captain davidson mark wahlberg to fight the monstrous apes , aided and abetted by a few turncoats notably helena bonham carter as ari . the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence , perfect for today's fast food mentality . the acting is mixed . mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role . walberg is excellent at playing dark , sullen characters that are tormented but strong . this part requires an inspirational hero , a profile not in wahlberg's repertoire . helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable . she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character , but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager . then there is tim roth . his is a virtuoso performance , single handedly saving the film from total ruin . roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade . he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time . additionally , his physical acting is superlative , rendering a chimp man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists . this film is a great disappointment . it is decent entertainment , as long as you check your brain at the door . i rated it a 3 10 . from a technical perspective it is much better than that , perhaps a 9 10 . however the story is an insult to the original franchise . it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation , using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is . of course it's true , but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films , instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption .",0,1

"though the title includes the word zombies , this film is not what you'd expect from a movie made today , though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected . dean jagger portrays armand louque , an officer in the french army of world war i , who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons , or zombies , who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war , though on whose side is not certain . at first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon , but eventually french general duval george cleveland orders a non military expedition into the ancient cambodian city of angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it . the story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving louque , duval's daughter claire dorothy stone , and clifford grayson robert noland , all a part of the expedition . when louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve , grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power . that advice begins to transform louque , particularly after he's successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city . having followed a temple priest into a swamp , louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking , though it's not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of zombiefication . all it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye , and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control . this comes in handy for winning back his girl , and taking grayson's early advice as he comments to his servant , buna , we're learning to be ruthless . fans of early b horror flicks will recognize the use of bela lugosi's signature eye stare , plucked from the 1932 film white zombie , also from director victor halperin . of the two movies , white zombie is preferably superior , both in story content and in it's depiction of the undead , where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening . in revolt , the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentor's commands . in fact , the actual revolt of the title occurs only when louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for claire ; they overrun his compound and kill him in the process . not to be too harsh on the film , it plays out decently within the parameters of it's story outline , but if you're thinking zombies ! within the traditional context , you'll probably be disappointed . if you want to sample an early treatment of the subject , the aforementioned white zombie with bela lugosi is the way to go .",0,1
"the seven collaborations between director joseph von sternberg and star marlene dietrich were so distinct in look and tone , and so different from anything else going on at the time , they almost seem to constitute a sub genre of their own . like any genre , they have their outright masterpieces , as well as their absolute turkeys . time to send blonde venus back to the farm . after the seedily seductive hits the blue angel , morocco and shanghai express , in which miss dietrich established her screen image as cabaret singer cum prostitute , someone at paramount decided it was time for marlene to play a mother . there is nothing wrong with that in itself ; as an actress she was up to the part . it's just that nothing else about the format has changed . it's like the blue angel plus a kid . fair enough , the story of a woman who drags her child along on her sleazy escapades is a sound premise for a tragic drama , but that's not the way this is played . dietrich's journey is played as some kind of adventure , using her wits and accomplices to stay ahead of the law . this is not some cheeky example of pre code libertarianism it is just bizarrely distasteful . although we may be able to accept marlene is a doting mommy , there is absolutely no way we can buy sternberg as a director of warmth and poignancy . in spite of this being one of the handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit , sternberg simply fails to get the story arc . the film's emotional payoff is supposed to be the eventual reunion of the family , but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth getting back to . as usual sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot to look like either brothels or insane asylums . the faradays' home is actually quite a creepy , dingy environment , and it's a wonder little johnny wasn't wetting the bed and asking to sleep with the light on . but as anyone familiar with them will know , the point of a dietrich sternberg picture is to make dietrich look fabulous , and in this respect at least blonde venus is a success . marlene is introduced emerging from a forest pool in a bright , shimmering close up , and even when she is reduced to rags the camera still loves her . the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast , whom sternberg tended to view as mobile pieces of scenery . the normally likable herbert marshall is here reduced to a moody grouch lurking in the shadows . even the suave and lively cary grant becomes just a boring , background blob , and does not seem nearly interesting enough for dietrich to run off with . the only standout moments in blonde venus are marlene's song and dance routines , especially the renowned hot voodoo number where she parodies her own surreal stage persona by emerging from a gorilla outfit . but even these feel like they have been cut and pasted from a different film . sternberg's fans may hail it as another masterpiece , as they are wont to do , but for the average punter it is a massive disappointment . audiences of the time did not lap it up as they had her earlier hits , and this heralded the beginning of the end for marlene's heyday . a year later there would be a new queen at paramount mae west .",0,1
"yes , chunky , this is the nick name that donna reeds' romantic lead played by tom drake tags her with ! so lets get this clear right away . from her first ing nue role in the get away 1941 too her last , dallas 1984 1985 ms . reed could never be described as chunky . not this attractive and slim actress . whose roles at m . g . m . seldom lived up to her talents . ms . reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors , who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged 'screw ball' comedy . clearly m . g . m . was out of their depth making this type of film . a type better produced over at columbia , paramount , rko and even universal . neither the 'touch' of ernst lubitsch nor the wit of preston sturges could save this film . a rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the markings of a pre war wwii effort . if irving thalberg had still been alive the screen play would have either gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day . it did fit into louis b . mayer's 'safe zone' of none challenging family entertainment . a form that could not stand up to the post war challenges of the 'dehavilland decision' , loss of their theater chains , television and would contribute to m . g . m . s decline . fortunetly for donna reed her best days are ahead of her culminating in from here to eternity 1953 and her oscar win as best supporting actress .",0,1
"on humphrey bogart's first trip to hollywood , he got his first leading man role in this b picture love affair . the first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with charles boyer and irene dunne or the two remakes that followed . it's not half as good any of those films . in fact bogey is second billed to dorothy mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser hale hamilton . it comes as quite a shock to mackaill . she considers a show business career as a way for an income . bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors . mackaill is willing to do it , besides she likes what she sees in bogey . considering the cynical roles that bogart later made a specialty , it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in love affair . the part doesn't wear well on him . love affair is your average b program second feature , nothing terribly special about it .",0,1
"a hard to find film which coasts on the still pervasive mythology of senator joe mccarthy as a political demon king . boyle as joe gives a compelling but historically inaccurate portrayal of the wisconsin senator , the caricature mccarthy many take as the real one . meredith , as wily army lawyer joseph welch , who outsmarted mccarthy at the army hearings in 1954 , is very good , as always . in fact , mccarthy and cohn were quite right in worrying about the appalling security situation in the army , and the 1954 army hearings became enmeshed in the smokescreen used by the army to deflect the investigation away from their security failings , which the committee were investigating , by counter charging that mccarthy and cohn were trying to get favours for their staffer , david schine , whilst in the service . the film is self satisfied agenda driven polemic , based in the pervasive myths which have passed for the truth with many people for decades that the red scare was essentially phony and mccarthy , huac etc were always blasting away at the wrong targets , being no more than lying , career ruining publicity hounds , who were trampling over the constitutional rights of startled innocent liberals , who were accused of being security risks communists . people who know little about the matter still feel confident in repeating misinformation on mccarthy and the red scare to this day clooney's murrow hagiography is an example . the misinformation is pervasive , no wonder people have swallowed it . a recent obit of budd schulberg in the serious left wing uk newspaper the guardian headlined that the hollywood writer named names to mccarthy perpetuating the lie that mccarthy investigated hollywood as head of huac the truth being that mccarthy was never even a member of huac and he had little interest in the politics of hollywood types his investigations were confined almost exclusively to arms of the us government . the mythology about the red scare being baseless is now completely exploded by recently opened soviet and us government documents , if anything mccarthy and co underestimated the sheer scale of soviet and fellow traveller infiltration in the us , but decades of public misinformation about this period will be hard to correct . one day maybe some really brave hollywood soul will make a movie telling the truth about how many american men and women clandestinely aided the mass murderer stalin , and worked to impose his vicious system of government on the western world , giving an accurate account maybe of joe mccarthy's career but i won't hold my breath . till then , we have this mythical , drunken lying scoundrel of popular imagination so familiar in the media . tail gunner joe .",0,1
". but it's certainly not without merit . already writer director preston sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories , creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations , and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue . no wonder the coen brothers' next movie is going to be an homage to sturges . the major problem is that the plot's not all the way there yet ; it lacks surprise , the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing . the coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon , and the ending is thoroughly predictable . frank capra does this sort of thing much better . if you're new to preston sturges , check out the lady eve or sullivan's travels or the miracle of morgan's creek first . if you've seen these already , then go ahead and watch this one .",0,1

"korine's established himself , by now , as a talented and impressive image maker . the promotional posters for mister lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions though there's one in particular i've yet to see in promo material that of a blue clad nun teasing a dog with a stick , surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down . the opening images of this film , of michael jackson lookalike diego luna riding a small motorbike round a track , is strangely compelling and beautiful roy orbison's mister lonely plays on the soundtrack , and the images unfold in slow motion . there's also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance , without music though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him , in the middle of a paris street ; korine splices in sound effects and jump cuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character's dance routine . the first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant ; father umbrillo werner herzog is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over , and drop food into , impoverished areas nearby . in a scene that is both light hearted and affecting , herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco . as the exchange develops , herzog draws out of the man a confession he has sinned , and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place . this scene , short and sweet , gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins the sinner is played by a non actor who was on set when korine and co . were filming and his adulterous ways had given him , in real life , a lasting , overwhelming guilt . henceforth , the film is hit and miss ; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous , muddled narrative . whereas gummo and julien donkey boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks , mister lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness . a few scenes were cut from the film , which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters , due to continuity errors in costume a result , no doubt , due to the absence of a shooting script and korine's tendency for improvisation . one deleted scene in particular in which 'charlie chaplin' denis lavant and 'madonna' melita morgan have sex would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film i won't spoil it , but it's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration , and , as it is , only half succeeds . the two strands of the narrative , unconnected literally , are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning ; one compliments the other and vice versa . it's something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation . but there's not enough of the herzog scenes to merit their place in the film , and so any connection between these two allegorically connected threads is inevitably strained and the inclusion is , in retrospect , tedious . this is an ambitious step forward from julien donkey boy that suffers mostly , at least in the lookalike segments , from having far too many characters for the film's running length , a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone as was originally planned . with many of the imagery's self contained beauty , and moments of real , genuine connection with the soundtrack , this feels like it'd be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition . as an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation , it'd lose none of its power indeed , for me , it would perhaps be more impressive . the loneliness attached to iconic performativity such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them is well captured in images such as that wherein 'marilyn monroe' a gorgeous samantha morton seduces the camera with a seven year itch pose in the middle of a forest , or when 'sammy davis , jr . ' jason pennycooke settles , post dance rehearsal , with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible , tranquil lake . as it is , moments like these , and all those where the titles of randomly chosen michael jackson songs crawl across the scene , are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be . for those who see it , i lost all faith during the egg singing scene , late on . you'll know which scene i mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb , as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which korine has previously been hailed .",0,1

"a tedious effort from not yet great director budd boetticher and pretty but not yet un bland actress nina foch , this movie is , as one of the other reviewers notes , is the quintessence of a certain kind of b movie . it's just not the good kind . and a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted . basic plot nina , a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves , has a nightmare . she meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a breather , and realizes he's in the dream , even though she's never met him before . meanwhile , it turns out our dashing guy is working as a spy , and is about to go on an extra secret , hush hush mission that must not fail . of course , there are nazis . and plot holes . and smart people acting in a fashion most likely to get them into entirely unnecessary scrapes , so that the running time can be spun out past an hour . at the end , the movie becomes a contest between which group of spies can act more foolishly . if the fbi and oss had acted like this crew , we'd have lost the war in '42 . the movie itself is rather flatly shot despite the best efforts of the fog machine and the acting as it seems to be in many of the columbia bs tcm has been showing lately is curiously unengaged . it's less stylized than what one might find from a similarly budgeted warner bros movie , but also less fun to watch . boetticher's strength , of course , is a rather matter of fact style which allows the strong stories and acting in his randolph scott westerns to come to the fore . maybe the problem here is that such a style is not going to work when the script is lousy and the actors tired from their five film a year schedule .",0,1

"let me begin by saying that i adore the book and loved the a e miniseries . i was hoping to love this film , and i was absolutely willing to allow it a moderate degree of artistic license in interpreting and abbreviating the actual story . however , this film scarcely resembles the original book . if only the names had been changed to protect the innocent , i would have possibly enjoyed the movie as simply an entertaining , if inaccurate , period piece . unfortunately , putting the name mr . darcy on a character who is emotional and weak , giving the name elizabeth bennett to a reckless , snippy , often teary eyed hoyden who cares nothing for the rules of society , and making mr . bingley a wide eyed dimwit absolutely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read jane austen's original story . there are some really stellar moments in this movie perhaps a total of 10 minutes are truly excellent . charlotte's explanation of why she accepted mr . collins' proposal begins beautifully . she is 27 years old quite near the hopeless spinster age in those times , she is becoming a burden on her family , and she is not romantic . she only wants a comfortable home . however , the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she blubbers , don't you judge me , elizabeth . don't you dare judge me ! and runs off in tears . later , you see charlotte kowtow to lady catherine de bourgh , which was not at all in her character as described in the book . another good moment is when darcy catches elizabeth in his home while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle . it was well done in the a e series , but the film version with keira knightley made the audience feel acutely how very humiliating that moment must have been for elizabeth . very nice . the ending also illustrated a level of affection between elizabeth and darcy that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries . i actually appreciated that scene , simply because i like to see a happy ending , rather than just know that it took place . altogether , though , this movie eliminated the subtlety that was such an integral part of austen's pride and prejudice . the characters speak in a jarring combination of austen's dialogue verbatim and modern phrases and colloquialisms . information that was only alluded to or suggested in the original work is blatantly stated in this version . yes , time was a concern . it's only a short movie , yada yada . but turning a complex , beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous . some have commented that they loved the moment when darcy first sees elizabeth , because it is so obviously a case of love at first sight . love at first sight ? huh ? one of the best aspects of the book is that elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty , and darcy comes to love her for her wit and liveliness . he literally loves her for her mind . this version also had a moment during darcy's first proposal when the two are yelling furiously at each other , while leaning closer . and closer . and almost kissing . but they suddenly step apart . ugh ! what a sad clich . they're angry and disgusted with each other , but so attracted that it doesn't matter that at the time they don't even like each other ? ridiculous ! the characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story . mr . bennet was dour , elizabeth usually acted just as silly as her younger sisters , charlotte was emotional , somewhat unintelligent and desperate for a home of her own unlike the intelligent , slightly scheming woman with an abundance of common sense who is portrayed in the novel . jane and elizabeth's relationship is merely topical , instead of the deep rooted love and admiration they are supposed to have for each other . all this i could have accepted as merely poor interpretations of the novel , but i refused to accept all that in addition to the many , many historical inaccuracies . miss bingley walked around scarcely clothed her dress looked like what the others would wear as tight undergarments . elizabeth walked to netherfield with her hair down and allowed to fly all over . the family lazed about one morning , though mornings were supposed to be reserved for calling on acquaintances or being called on at your own home . elizabeth walked outside barefoot in her nightgown . and in a really appalling scene , bingley walked into jane's bedroom and conversed with her and sounded like an idiot when she was ill . most people would feel these are minor points , but i simply wanted either a . an historically accurate film , or b . an accurate representation of the characters in the novel . the director writer whoever sacrificed accuracy , subtlety and a good story for a trite tale of love at first sight . i can concede that those who have not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the time could very easily like this movie , and there is nothing wrong with that . i simply couldn't overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than just two pretty faces .",0,1

"the lady in cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60's . the writing , not the acting , is at center stage . did i say pure camp ! prepare to be offended if you are female or gay . broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day camp wise . most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors . the action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see dan blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs . and lanie kazan and racquel welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers . amazing to note they were both 28 years old and mr . sinatra was 53 . the musical score , wait . . . was there a score ? well , you get the point . watch it with friends who want a good laugh . it's full of them .",0,1
"the saddest thing about this tribute is that almost all the singers including the otherwise incredibly talented nick cave seem to have missed the whole point where cohen's intensity lies by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise , cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry , his irony , his all round humanity , laughter and tears in one . to see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces , launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream i'm a singer ! , is a true pain . it's the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as lennon's imagine . nothing , simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original . if there is a form of art that doesn't need embellishments , it's cohen's art . embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make up of sex for sale . in this cohen's tribute i found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations , all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and , if truth be told , several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show . it's cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material , really , not the other way around they may have been friends , or his daughter's , he could have become very tender hearted and in the mood for a gift . too bad it didn't stay in the family . fortunately , but only at the very end , cohen himself performed his majestic tower of song , but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the u2 , all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing home . a sad show , really , and sadder if you truly love cohen as i do .",0,1
for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings . the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies funny situations again and again and again . it is to predictable . it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anything . i like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it's audience .,0,1
"i can only guess that this movie was an experiment that misfired . years earlier , it would have been moving images accompanied by music . later , it would have been sound added to silents . eventually it would have been technicolor , cinemascope or imax . this movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element to the talking picture . during all the emotional scenes , the character stops in mid dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while they gaze off into the distance or appeal to the camera . this interruption is painful at it's very least . imagine these top tier actors trying to look busy while the narration drones on . painful . i have no idea who came up with this gimmick , but it was the only time i ever saw it used and for good reason . in every scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes , wring their hands , or overact to such a degree , i actually wondered if this was really a comedy . the story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations . norma shearer , disappointed in love , searches for a reason to live . she has a friend , played by ralph morgan , who worships her but she takes him for granted . she is attracted to a doctor , played by clark gable , but he is self absorbed and isn't interested in her . she settles for a weakling that needs her desperately . she marries him only to find that there is insanity in his family and she can never have a child with him . along comes the doctor who selfishly pops a bun in her oven , only to find out later that he loves her after all . the child builds confidence in her husband who becomes a success , but she realizes that it's really clark she loves after all . confused yet ? forget the rest , just watch a couple of episodes of as the world turns and it'll all become clear . if your are ever forced to watch this movie , hold out for the final scene . the gyrations of the actors put harold lloyd to shame . it is not to be missed .",0,1

"follows the usual formula in putting a new recruit this time the first african american cuba gooding after president truman desegregates the armed forces through the u . s . navy's deep sea diver training program that is run by a racist zealot robert deniro . if the program weren't bad enough , it's got to be located in bayonne , new jersey . there's nothing wrong with the performances . robert de niro activates his southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively . cuba gooding , raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the south , is the expectable paragon of rectitude . the girls one could hardly call them women are charleze theron and lonette mckee . they have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense . other decent performers powers boothe and hal holbrook have even more perfunctory roles . that's about it . almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer . a ship is called a boat . robert de niro salutes indoors , uncovered . after a brutal assault on hospital personnel , he's transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted . somebody shouts i'm outta here in the early 1950s . maybe it was a common expression at the time . if so , my bad . people address each other by rank lieutenant , boatswain's mate , commander , as they do in the army , whereas in the navy they are simple mister if an officer or addressed by their last name if enlisted . i didn't bother to check if there was a rank called senior master chief in 1950 . cuba gooding has a tough row to hoe . everyone in the navy , it seems , hates negroes except for one guy from wisconsin . he stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class . it's like the scene in animal house , in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a sikh , a black man , and a blind kid . gooding is an enlisted man , a second class petty officer . he manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school . in one of their arguments she pleads with him . she just wants to be a doctor and he should join her , quit the navy , and lead a quiet life . and just let life pass you by ? , he retorts . yes . yes , just be a doctor's spouse and let life pass you by . you can wave to it from the golf course in boca raton . these kinds of flicks were common enough in world war ii . bombardier , airial gunner , that sort of thing . cheap as they often were , they had some educational features . you learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner . here , the technical details are skipped over , perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them except boyle's law , which we learned in high school chemistry . i couldn't follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this wouldn't exist . if i got the mechanical problems right , it was because i guessed correctly . the direction is no help either . the movie abounds in close ups , so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had . and the emergencies are confusing because they're ill focused . why go on ? want to see a better example of this kind of movie ? almost any will do except maybe g . i . jane , in which the abused hero is a heroin . try the training camp scenes in the young lions . there the victim is a jew . or try from here to eternity , in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on , just like cool hand luke . no easy excuses are offered , because easy excuses are too easy . thoroughly formulaic , and not well done .",0,1
"poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy , tired of the hollywood glamor treatment . first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli , an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress . and now it's europa 51 , another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment . nor does the story do much for alexander knox , in another thankless role as her long suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son . at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than stromboli . bergman is still attractive here , but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman . she's never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son , despite attempts by a kindly male friend . sometimes i think i'm going out of my mind , she tells her husband . a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace , but it does give us a sense of where the story is going . bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post war rome , but being a social worker with poor children doesn't improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse . the film's overall effect is that it's not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman . the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she's two timing him . the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street walker through her terminal illness . the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum . ingrid suffers nobly through it all over compensating for the loss of her son but it's no use . not one of her best flicks , to put it mildly . trivia note if she wanted neo realism with mental illness , she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak ! it would have done more for her career than europa 51 . summing up another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman .",0,1
"although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release , i feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast . the issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn't convincing enough especially when looking at the mini film . i also don't believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable . the issues are still crucial but boys from the blackstuff cannot fully aid the cause of understanding the problems in britain in the 1980s .",0,1
"i was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out . commercials for it made it look quirky and i generally like morgan freeman and chris rock , and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea . sadly , i was terribly disappointed with nurse betty . personally , i've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together , and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully , in my opinion , are tarantino and the coens . there isn't that much violence in nurse betty , but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when i was supposed to laugh . of course , for me , part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where i was being asked to . the film doesn't much work as a drama , either . renee zellweger's betty , the story's protagonist , is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way . i will say zellweger acts the role quite well , and freeman , rock , and greg kinnear all do good jobs too . the problem is in the writing ; freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character . it's really too bad . 3 10",0,1
"jefferson in paris is a truly confounding film . it presents thomas jefferson nick nolte in the most unflattering light possible , painting him as a liar , racist and pedophile , yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins . this is the way he was , the film seems to say . end of sentence , end of movie , the door's behind you . after arriving in paris with his daughter patsy gwenyth paltrow , jefferson proceeds to win the heart of maria cosway greta scacchi , the wife of a homosexual english painter the criminally underused simon callow . a turn of events sends maria to england , however , and jefferson proceeds to forget her with astonishing speed for a man who , mere minutes of screen time before , was asking her to live with him in america . he's been bewitched , you see , by sally hemmings thandie newton , one of his slaves just arrived from america . just why he's bewitched is hard to tell although sally is undeniably beautiful , she acts like a simple minded child in front of jefferson . when she isn't telling ghost stories in exaggerated darky speech patterns , she's slinking around his bedroom , practically oozing lust for her distinguished massa . if her behavior is an attempt to excuse jefferson's , it doesn't work . jefferson damns himself further when maria , tired of waiting for his letters , travels from england to see him . i've not changed toward you , he insists , offering weak excuses for not writing . to her credit , maria sees through his brazen lies immediately . when sally appears , and she and jefferson flirt openly and cruelly , to my mind in maria's very presence , the illusion falls apart completely . no one today believes that jefferson , washington and the rest were utter paragons of virtue and morality . yet , are we supposed to believe that the learned , distinguished jefferson would be attracted to sally , a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how massa's frenchie friends don' unnastan' aw corn and who rubs herself against his front as she passes , right before maria's eyes ? even if we let that slide , it's followed by the horrifying revelation that sally was only 15 when this affair took place jefferson was 41 . strangely , this fact comes out only toward the very end , when sally's brother james is understandbly furious at her blase announcement that she is carrying jefferson's child . jefferson is equally blase when told that sally is carrying his child , and patronizingly tells her that she'd be far better off under his protection than free and living in france with her brother . but , he promises , i'll free her when i die and our children including any more that come , jefferson says , in a chilling declaration of sally as his when they reach 21 . oh thank you , massa , you feel like telling the screen . big deal . the worst scene is still to come , however , involving jefferson's daughter patsy . she is already angry at him , first for breaking his vow , made to her mother on her deathbed , not to marry again . obviously the woman wasn't just talking about matrimony . jefferson has also refused to allow patsy to become a nun as she wishes , despite earlier moralizing about freedom of religion that seems to mean freedom to agree with him . having promised sally and her brother their freedom , jefferson calls in patsy to witness the bargain and promise to fulfill it should anything happen to him . sally's brother blurts out the impending birth of the child , and jefferson asks , do you swear ? paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant , although she has almost nothing to say . her face nearly contorts in agonizing pain at this revelation , yet she controls her grief and whispers yes . if anything , and the filmmakers could have had something if they'd emphasized this point more , jefferson in paris is an indication of the status of woman in the late 18th century , viewed even by men like jefferson as attractive property , pleasing but without true intellect or souls . we see jefferson shed a few tears over a letter from maria , obviously telling him where to get off , but he's soon laughing away at a wild dance from sally , complete with tossed hair and heaving bosom . i don't know whether this is an accurate portrait of jefferson or not . i don't care to watch it , however , just for the sake of watching it . this jefferson is no hero or even an anti hero . he's a selfish , lying child molestor and one who gets away with it not the kind of man i want to see a movie about .",0,1

"the word honor should be erased from the vocabularies of all nations . it aggravates male dumbness and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people . anybody who does not agree should not care to continue reading this comment . as can be expected with these screenwriters , yakuza is an engaging crime thriller with quite a lot of respect for the ethnical background against which it is acted out . friends of gore and violence will not be disappointed either , but especially towards the end violence becomes somewhat pointless , redundant and downright silly . contrary to other reviewers i found robert mitchum's performance not very good . this is an actor who definitely did not improve with age . he looks like a tired janitor it does not go too well with the part , and his air of detachment which made him such an impressive screen presence in earlier years comes through as either confusion or lack of interest . ken takakura and richard jordan are very good as man of honor and young , intelligent , feeling thug respectively . the best way to stand this movie is seeing it as a tragic comedy . things are set in motion by the mitchum character's asking the takakura character a favor based on wrong assumptions . the error quickly becomes evident , but the sense of honor demands they must not back off . so they start sneaking around , shooting in all directions , wielding swords and wrecking their friend's arty apartment although the guy pleads with them stop it , please all through the corresponding fight . bodies start piling up and the story ends with mitchum's character making his point if you give him your little finger , i will give you mine . well , it's the least he can do , can't he ? so he pulls out a knife , takes a resigned breath and starts sawing off said extremity outside the frame , luckily . it was a moment which probably should have been solemn . it just made me laugh . the use of locations is very good in this movie . i particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the international conference hall on lake takaragaike , an interesting futuristic building by architect sachio otani the kyoto protocol was signed there . to me the presentation of architecture seems better here than in sydney pollack's more recent documentary sketches of frank o . gehry which is about architecture and nothing else .",0,1

"as i write this in november 2005 i've become aware that the great british boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the british government not giving film makers tax breaks i think the cause is much simpler a lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . let's have a look at what the brits were producing 1995 2005 funky gangster thrillers . lock stock and two smoking barrales was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape guy ritchie's style with usually disappointing results romantic comedies . yeah okay i do realise four weddings , notting hill etc were produced by american studios but they're still vaguely british films . unfortunately because they're guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved hugh grant playing hugh grant for the umpteenth time black comedies . can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is ? in the british context it's usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles mike leigh's naked jasmin disdar's beautiful people is a good example of the third type of british movie . filmed in 1999 but set in 1993 it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and it's later revealed that one's a serb and one's a croat so we get a bite sized rundown of what was happening in the balkans at that time , though what's the odds of two former enemies in the balkans bumping into each other on a london bus ? this sums up one of the major flaws of the movie irony takes precedence over likely situations , you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely ? perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film . it's called beautiful people but certainly this audience member found them clich d stereotypical people that i couldn't believe in as three dimensional characters",0,1
"'the mill on the floss' was one of the lesser novels by mary ann evans , who wrote under the male pseudonym george eliot . i tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago , but was unable to finish it . i'll review this film version solely on its own merits , as i don't know how faithfully it follows the original novel . the film's opening credits are printed in an old english typeface that suggests the mediaeval period , and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th century setting . on the other hand , about halfway into the film , we see a close up shot of a handbill advertising an estate auction . this handbill is set in authentic victorian type fonts , and looks very convincing . most of this film is extremely convincing in its depiction of the architecture and clothing of early 19th century england . the precise location of this film's story is never disclosed , but judging by the actors' accents i'd place it as somewhere in the cotswolds , perhaps warwickshire . the plot , what there is of it , involves a mill that changes hands a couple of times over a couple of decades between two rival families , one wealthy and one working class . i disagree with another imdb reviewer who claims that james mason has only a small role in this film . mason has the largest and most central role in this drama , as the scion of the wealthier family . as the spoilt and petulant tom tulliver , mason is darkly brooding and impetuous . his performance here belongs in a better film it made me want to see 'wuthering heights' recast with mason as heathcliff . as this is a multi generational saga something which george eliot did much better in 'middlemarch' , several of the main roles in this film are split among two actors apiece child actors in the prologue , adults in the main narrative . the prologue of this film features a very well written scene , establishing tom tulliver as wilful and bully ragging from an early age , and young philip wakeham as decent and thoughtful . through hard labour , philip has earned a halfpenny tom tries to bully it away from him , but is unwilling to take the coin by brute force he wants philip to give it to him . all the child actors in this movie , male and female , are talented and attractive . unfortunately , all of the children speak their dialogue in posh plummy voiced accents that are utterly unlike the accents of the actors and actresses who play those same roles as adults . this discrepancy calls attention to the staginess of the material . regrettably , none of the later scenes are as good as this prologue . the climax features a crowd of labourers in a rainstorm , much better paced and photographed than the earlier scenes . but modern viewers in britain , at least can no longer take this sort of material seriously . by now , practically every british comedian has done a trouble at t' mill , squire comedy routine , parodying precisely this subject matter , so i had difficulty watching this movie with a straight face . the character actress martita hunt is good in a small role , but the opening credits in that old english typeface misspell her forename as 'marita' . i'll rate this dull movie 3 points out of 10 one point apiece for james mason's performance , the early scene with the children , and the authentic victorian typesetting in that auctioneer's handbill .",0,1

"i saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though i knew it wasn't of award winning caliber . i kinda liked it . it tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids which is to climb mt . whitehead . of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways , but none too differently than they were as children . richard lewis is still neurotic , richard belzer is still a playboy , franklyn ajaye is still sort of the dear abby of the group , and tim thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group . of course the top billed star is louie anderson , a true believer in everything cub scout related . he still lives in the same house with his mother , still goes over the cub scout manual daily , is brave , reverent and clean , and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in scouting . compounding their task , however , is the grunski brothers , two bullies drummed out of the cub scouts by the above mentioned . by coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit , albeit harmlessly . not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts , who think pack 7 is from the fbi and are intent on wiping them out . all in all , the movie still has bits of charm . observe richard lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot , for example , and you have a really funny bit going for you . upon further review , the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor . it doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure .",0,1

"when i finally had the opportunity to watch zombie 3 zombie flesheaters 2 in europe on an import region 2 japanese dvd , i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is . the transfer is just about immaculate , as good as it's ever going to look unless anchor bay gets a hold of it . the gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx . the sound is also terrific . it's only 2 channel dolby but if you have a receiver with dolby prologic 2 , you can really appreciate the cheesy music actually a very good score , and the effective although cheap sound effects . it never sounded so good , and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment . i never realized just how much blood flows in this film , it's extremely brutal with exploding head shots , exploding puss filled mega pimples , a cleaver to a zombies throat , a woman's burned off extremities how come it did'nt burn the guy also , intestinal munching , zombie babies and so much more i lost track . this is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fans , especially of the italian kind . there is some excellent set pieces and cinematography to be found , i think people don't give it enough credit , if you see a clean print , and not some horrendous pirate copy , it's a whole other experience entirely . this film never lets up for a second , and i realize it's inconsistent plotwise , the dubbing is horrible , the acting is stiff , and it's sense of irreverence is celebrated in grand fashion , but that's part of it's charm . to me this is one of the best horror films ever made , you can't make a film this bad , so good , on purpose . it's accidental genius of the highest order . if they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster , but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it's nose at any and all traditional moviemaking standards . tons of action sequences , exotic locales , excellent set design , good , sometimes great cinematography , wonderfully cheesy acting , and inconsistent but still interesting plot , great makeup effects , beautiful women who can kick butt , excellent music , and sometimes hilarious , sometimes creepy , but always entertaining zombies . how can you go wrong with this film , it has it all , a cult classic that stands the test of time .",0,1
"although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful , the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story . one may believe that middle class teen age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30 year old's they barely know , but i doubt it . one may believe that young high school teens are highly self confident and self assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations , but my experience has been , more often than not , teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world . one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake , but i think not . one may believe that 30 something year old troublemakers can enter into , and hang around inside , a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble , but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents , chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this . one final nit , throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome . there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome , but because it was never detailed , each reference distracts from each scene . this movie did not ring true for me .",0,1

"i really wanted to like this film , but so much of it is stolen borrowed from other work some of the borrowing is painfully blatant . the new york times' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous warner brothers' cartoon 'hello my baby , hello my darlin' , hello my ragtime gal .

"here is a film which clearly banks on being marketed as exotica to audiences unfamiliar with its subject matter . an attempted hybrid of fiction and document , kadosh clumsily falls in between the chairs . as a documentary , on the one hand , it is neither accurate nor insightful . to realize its sloppy handling of detail , one needs to go no further than the opening scene where it is quite obvious that the ultra orthodox protagonist does not know even so much as how to properly put on his t'filin . more generally , the tedious rote style presentation of details in this case of jewish ultra orthodox ritual is the role of a manual , not of a good documentary ; the latter should provide an organizing principle a gestalt , if you will for the viewer , so that she may emerge with a better understanding of the viewed . this clearly does not happen here , as ultra orthodox ritual is being made even more enigmatic . the director seems to have done a decent job explaining it all verbally during the film's release campaign ; cinematically , however , this is a severe case of stuttering . as a fiction feature , on the other hand , it suffers from flatness of character , simplicity of plot and bluntness of message . at some points i felt i was watching a cartoon . e . g . the wedding night consummation scene without going in detail into angles , positions and dimensions . well , technically this could not possibly be a realistic portrayal of human sex , savage as it may be . there are no subtleties in this film . the clever manipulation of hints , stimulating the viewer's imagination and thought into taking an active part in the cinematic text , which i believe is a mark of a good feature , is completely absent . on the contrary watching the movie i felt , at times , as being force fed again and again with the same already chewed up and way too obvious content . it is , indeed , as director gitai himself put it in an interview , an architectural shifting objects in space , and then coloring the scenes with the appropriate emotions when called for and advancing the plot on its appropriate and predictable track ; but the spark , that creative , duende like dark , inarticulable spark let's not forget kadosh is supposedly a tragedy , that which casts on a two dimensional screen the spell which turns it into an extension of the viewers world , is missing without a trace . perhaps a work of a visual engineer , perhaps of an unsophisticated ideologue ; definitely not of a true filmmaker . what i saw was a passion play for animated issues rather than flesh blood and complexities real people . the acting , by and large , failed to transcend this directorial flatness of an idea forced at times even tortured into film . one notable , though relatively minor , exception was that of the mikve lady and the mother , both played by the excellent and seasoned lea koenig . it takes more than strict adherence to a winning formula namely , a serving of exotica , plus heart wrenching yet simple melodrama , plus a popular agenda , preferably politically correct to tantalize my interest buds . the bottom line here , all being said , is that for a considerable portion of the movie i was simply bored . in spite of the novel , perhaps even pioneering achievement of using an ultra orthodox neighborhood as a movie set , for which mr . gitai and his crew deserve all praise , i found kadosh way too nadosh hebrew for trite .",0,1

"i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently . in my opinion , the film started out decent enough , but eventually got sour . the story a u . s . soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the u . s . has sent out to troops for christmas . he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life , a motivation to continue on . when he is given leave , he goes to the very town that the woman lives in . he comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card . he meets the family and after saving her dad a vietnam war veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street , the family decides to take him in for a while . we learn that he doesn't have a family back home . the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their logging company . the family comes to love him and vice versa . the soldier also becomes in love with the family's daughter the woman that sent the christmas card . there's only one problem . she already has a serious relationship with a man that she's in love with . it's also a long distance relationship . the boyfriend is very different from the soldier . he prefers wine and trips to france over hard labor and the great outdoors . the woman prefers the latter . throughout the rest of the film , there is a love triangle as the woman's boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season . everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what's best for her daughter . spoiler alert the woman comes to like the soldier more and more , as they have a lot in common . they happen to spend a lot of time together . she gradually becomes attracted to his persona . then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back . now she's so confused ! she's in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday , but she's become so fond of the soldier . soon enough , the boyfriend who doesn't know about the kiss , but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to propose to the woman and she accepts . his plans for their marriage , however , are not plans that she wants . she wants to be at home , have kids and be close to her family . he wants to travel the world , go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along . this doesn't sound too thrilling for the woman . however , the soldier feels bad about what he's done and doesn't want to make things worse . so , he decides to leave town , despite the dad's urging him to stay and be with his daughter . it all comes to a head when , at the christmas eve service with church , we find out that the soldier hasn't left yet . the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he , broken hearted , basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her . the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together . things i like i like the soldier throughout much of the film . he's basically nice and polite , with a strong sense of doing good for others ; there are moments in which the family is going with church and participating in charitable causes ; the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table ; the dad and mom have a long lasting and evidently healthy marriage ; the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong things i don't like there is a very typical love triangle story in this film ; the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend ; most of the family practically applauds this behavior the family goes with church and participates in services , yet this is how they act ; there is some bad language conclusion i became disappointed as the film ran on , and it got worse and worse . i ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because i had enough . so , the film started out decent with some few gem moments , but ended up ruining itself . therefore , i don't recommend this film to anyone .",0,1

"the film makers went well out of their way to find only the following demographics palestinians that have the appearance of peace loving , solution seeking good will , palestinians particularly older women and families with children who are especially inconvenienced by the security fence , and israelis that don't believe in the security fence , sympathize heavily with its alleged effect on palestinians , and consider it unnecessarily divisive and or a waste of money . oh yes , they do put in one member of the israeli government that does support the fence , but they do what they can to portray him as inhumane and uncaring , and ask him very leading questions that are really statements e . g . the wall is bad for the environment . it is destroying everything . i have no problem with any well , most of this being presented in the movie . however much i may disagree with the people they interview , their opinions are valid enough for a documentary . however there are at least two sides to the issue of israel's security fence , and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of israelis and many others support the construction of the fence and believe it is having an overall positive influence , this documentary does not present the opinion of even one such person . they even go so far as to interview an israeli jew who claims that all israelis support the fence and are thus insane , and then stubbornly refuse to interview even one such crazy israeli . oh , and to top all this off , they set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young israeli children truly exceptions to the rule i've been there that are laughing at about their arab neighbors from across the fence . a documentary is a film that explores an issue and presents a full array of facts , opinions , and perspectives . unfortunately , this is not a documentary . this is an unabashed propaganda film that very clearly , very pointedly offers a battery of support for only one side of a heavily disputed , emotionally and politically charged issue . it is no more of a documentary than , say , fahrenheit 9 11 .",0,1
"i notice that the previous reviewer who appears to be still at school gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel . the major problem i had with this 1999 version was the casting of anthony way as tom long . anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini series the choir . i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in the choir . unfortunately the small boy who appeared in the choir had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time tom's midnight garden was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom . it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom as played by anthony would befriend the far younger hatty . in the 1989 bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable . for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects . the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic . as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version fetches well over 20 . 00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under 5 . 00 , need i say more ?",0,1

"this series doesn't present the british view of the revolutionary war , so much as an anti american view of it . the underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of colonists enjoyed british rule ; that the founding fathers were manipulative schemers whose only goal was to draw britain into a violent civil war ; that the american supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist , violent louts , duped into the struggle . clearly , the intent of the author , richard holmes , is for the viewer to extrapolate these characteristics , in a straight line , from the american population of 1775 to today . for example , in the episode the shot heard around the world holmes dredges up an obscure print of the boston massacre , in which he claims the skin of crispus attucks , a black man and the first man killed in the revolution , was purposely whited out . holmes claims that portraying attucks as a black man would have been bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause . holmes never reveals how he knows this . and there's more . holmes goes to some length to work in a single , unsubstantiated , atrocity the desecration of the body of a british soldier . he compares the american militia to the viet cong and the mujahadeen without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups . the list goes on . supposedly , this series was made in response to mel gibson's the patriot . it says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to mel gibson on any topic . instead of presenting the british view , it seems holmes really wanted to give a sensationalistic , anti american view , and , in the process , he's made himself the roger corman of historians strictly third rate schlock .",0,1

! when lt pat robertson was in the marines during the korean war he was a liquor officer , responsible for keeping the officers supplied with liquor . he was known to drink himself and frequent prostitutes and he feared he contacted gonorrhea . should of asked a faith healer for help ! the reason pat got out of combat was because his daddy absalom willis robertson d va from 1946 66 was chairman of the senate military appropriations committee . terrorist attacks , september 11 , 2001 we have imagined ourselves invulnerable and been consumed by the pursuit of health , wealth , pats worth between 150 and 200 million dollars folks ! material pleasures a mansion in virginia beach virginia with a helicopter launching pad ! and sexuality he had had sex with his future wife before marriage which they had a son ! . it terrorism is happening because god is lifting his protection from us . statement released on september 13 , 2001 . pat robertson reminds me of burgermeister on santa claus is coming to town and his evil vengeful god reminds me of venger on dungeons and dragons . spoiled brat gordon does what daddy pat tells him to and terry is a paid yes woman who neither have minds of their own ! this will really grab you ! the september 5 2005 edition of the 700 club included a report christian broadcasting network correspondent gary lane from outside new orleans convention center which has housed mostly impoverished black disaster victims throughout the weekend . a number of possessions left behind suggest the mindset of some of the evacuees lane said they include this voodoo cup with the saying may the curse be with you . a shot of a plastic cup souvenir cup from one of the new orleans countless trinket shops appeared on the screen . also music cds with the title guerrilla warfare and thugs 'r' us . lane stated , pointing out a pile or rap cds strewn on the ground . his bigoted daddy absalom has taught pat racism well ! if any of you good people ever think of donating to these sexist bigoted people please in the name of god don't ! sponsor a softball or basketball team , give to a food shelf , be a big brother or sister to a child but please don't give to these people because they have been around for over 40 years and solved nothing . if you still don't believe me type pat robertson overheard during commercial break on the web and hit search and once you hear what hes really like , i know for sure that you will not give one cent to these conning liars ! and by the way terry once had a divorce and pat has talked against divorce many times on his shows . i like to say hello to the folks in dover pennsylvania , orlando florida , and to the nice folks who got hit by hurricane katrina and i hope its a pleasant day . has operation blessing been helpful to new orleans ?

"the film is a gross misrepresentation of orthodox lifestyle and practice . never will a jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples . although the concept exists in jewish law , the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place . childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life , but nowhere are they rejected by their community as depicted in the film . they are treated with extreme sensitivity . in fact , many great rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce . the depiction of yosef , a horrible human being , is meant to perhaps subconsciously show the behavior of a typical orthodox male . in reality , it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society . both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable . it is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a movie by someone who is personally biased against a community . i have always thought that it is only the orthodox , because of their narrow mindedness and insular lifestyle , who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers or see in the movies .",0,1
"i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story good actors but mismatched , and i would also say rushed . it has been about 24years since i read the book as it was in school . but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out therefore it doesn't fully make sense . for example jane mr rochester have hardly spoken suddenly he is proposing marriage ! the actors don't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story . the actors are good but aren't given enough time to do this story justice . i'm sorry to say it but i didn't really enjoy this version . the 1970 version with susanna york george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the 1983 bbc mini series version with zelah clarke timothy dalton in the 2 main roles . i love it so much i watch it regularly . there is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins .",0,1
"this movie has not aged well . maybe it's just the impact and artful characterization , acting , and directing that we've seen with the sopranos , but i just viewed prizzi's honor for the first time , on dvd , alone . the experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different , but i have to say , i was just appalled at the ending . not just the violence of it , but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending . i enjoy a good shocker , but this seemed so out of character . also , when was this move supposed to be set ? the cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s , and yet the world trade center towers completed in 1973 were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes . another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person . somehow , mid 1980s audiences found this film charming and funny . mid eighties , meet the late oughts only of you can live .",0,1
"on broadway , a chorus line was pure magic . from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale , a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show , we were totally engaged captivated by the intensely personal stories , some funny , some clever , some stirring , of this chorus line . the movie is another matter entirely . the focus is now on the director and what an ogre he is ! every time the film switches to michael douglas , there he is with a bitter , sour expression , barking out questions and orders , screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance . yikes ! that changes the dynamics of the story . on broadway , the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence , but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong fragile intriguing hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity . there is a reason this work won the pulitzer prize ! and actually in one of the only moments the director appears , he is there to comfort the young puerto rican dancer after we hear that dancer's heart breaking story . he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection concern for cassie . but in the movie , from the second douglas' director starts bitterly barking orders , the chorus line members' stories become secondary . it's like they are in a lousy profession , where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show , is jaded , exhausted , furious at having to audition these chorus members . on stage , there was always the excitement of the show . here in the movie practically from the word go , you feel sorry for everyone involved . during the course of the musical , we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well , and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job ! but of course that couldn't happen . but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage , sometimes reflecting us in the audience , in our hearts , and we know , also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected , they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much , bringing magic to the theatre . in the movie , after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis , that magic becomes totally diluted . all we feel even with the exact same curtain call , is that some of the members got a job with a mean spirited director . so they all come on the screen and are dancing again . big deal .",0,1
"wakayama tomisaburo's portrayal of fugitive ex kaishakunin ogami itto felt entirely natural . his demeanor , his voice , his appearance all of it spoke to dislodgement . when he entered a space i , as well as characters on the screen , could feel he didn't belong there and that his determination to be there spelled trouble . i read somewhere that mr . wakayama actually took kendo japanese swordsmanship training and that would explain his comfort with the katana , which showed magnificently in every cutfest . if you watch the movies , from the moment he draws to the moment he sheaths the sword you feel as though you were witnessing something inevitably ugly . he'd even spin the katana quickly to flick off the blood before sheathing it and it would happen in an effortless instant . nakamura kinnosuke's rendition comes across as a rendition . it feels as though he were trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story . as a result , every time i tried to engage i'd lose my grip because he didn't seem to have a firm grip on the role , himself . as though it were awkward for him . the swordsmanship in the tv series was entirely old school hollyweird , too . camera cuts to disguise mr . nakamura's awkwardness with the katana , slow action , targets sitting still , etc . extremely bad , from a viewer's perspective . there was a moment in the episode the castle wall attack when mr . nakamura drew his sword like a child . it was embarrassing . he handled it as though it were heavy ! i almost fell off my chair . and let's be frank the story is about an excellent swordsman . period . swordsmanship is an issue . realism isn't , however the swordplay in the movies was excellent and manga like , as was intended , i'm sure . the baby cart was outfitted with a cluster of automatic , rapid fire muskets operated by a 3 year old ? yes . manga style . it's how the story seamlessly weaves historical cultural accuracy into , basically , superhero fantasy that makes the movies captivating . read yoshikawa eiji's musashi historical legend ! i couldn't really sit through the tv series episodes . they just felt cheap . see the movies first and you'll know what i'm talking about .",0,1

"apart from the da james eckhouse , and a brief appearing woman who is convincingly sympathetic to ellen gulden's renee zellweger plight , ellen herself is the only convincing character and likable character in the movie . she is the one , not her dying mother , who should be and is the one true thing . it's not only in the role , in zellweger's acting , but also in the plot itself . until , the plot turns against itself and makes the mother the one true thing in the eyes of her weak willed , shallow husband who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter . the daughter perceives what the viewer perceives , but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is blanked out on both the realities of his wife and daughter . to boot , the one powerful scene in this whole movie , when ellen confronts her father's cruelty , is given the lie at the end . ellen is just another young strong woman who must be tamed into conformity by a crybaby father . a very flawed movie so flawed as to be called a bore and not worth the time .",0,1
"billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to deliver . the problem is that while beautifully photographed it has no consistent story line or narrative . starting as a murder mystery it offers no hope to its actors as it meanders through recent history . depardieu is wasted in a trivial role he obviously is not comfortable with playing . adjani cannot carry the picture . the hero is not ; obviously an imitation of a hitchcock wrongly accused role it lacks balance . neither heroic , comic nor suspenseful . this could have been a good film . i am reminded of the lady vanishes which did combine suspense , romance and comedy in a serious film dealing with fascism .",0,1

"even thought i'm not the biggest of cher fans , this movie was her crowning achievement . granted , there were long term side effects and risks of brain damage , memory loss and intellectual impairment , upon the screening such a film . a 1989 survey of moonstruck fans by the uk advocacy network revealed that one third of 300 moonstruck fans surveyed believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80 claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds . cher plays someone very un cher in this movie , a dowdy young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family . they're anti american , pro italian and always at each other in someway . she has been going out with johnny camarary for a while , a nice mamma's boy man , and he asks her to marry him . she says yes . i loved her mom's questions do you love him loretta ? , no . , good . if you love him he'll drive you crazy because they know they can . but you like him then ? , oh yeah , he's a sweet man ma . when johnny goes off to sicily to care for his dying mother , he asks that loretta make contact with his brother who he's been estranged from for years . this victory for human rights carries even greater significance , as sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment . in 1938 , italian psychiatrist ugo cerletti , saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs , easing the job of slitting their throats . cerletti was inspired , and began experimenting with electroshock on humans , developing the first electroshock machine . broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern . this was , in so many ways , an anti american movie . it's about love , to be sure , but it's also about infidelity , secrets , lonely people , and strange behavior brought on by american policies . the characters , from the frumpy bobo at the favorite restaurant , the aunt and uncle , her parents and their problems , the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters . it's somewhat of a chick flick , as it's how loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp . it's a cinderella story in many ways , and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan . assuming free and fully informed consent , it is well to reaffirm the individual's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses . but we might ask ourselves whether we , as fans of cinema , though in no way sworn to any hippocratic oath , should be offering it .",0,1

"memoirs of a geisha is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a camp , drag queen satire than anything to do with real people . the first half of the film defensively keeps insisting that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines , that they are the embodiment of traditional japanese beauty . but other than one breathtaking dance , the rest of the movie degenerates into pretty baby in storyville territory , or at least vashti and esther in the purim story , as all the women's efforts at art and artifice are about entertaining much , much older , drunken boorish men . maybe it is japanese culture that is being prostituted , and not just to the american louts after world war ii . perhaps it's the strain of speaking in english , but ziyi zhang shows barely little of the great flare she demonstrated in house of flying daggers shi mian mai fu and hero ying xiong . michelle yeoh occasionally gets to project a glimmer of her assured performance in crouching tiger , hidden dragon wo hu cang long . only li gong shows any real life . otherwise , i kept picturing charles ludlam in various roles , or even cillian murphy , as in kabuki theater , particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight . the supposed love story has zero chemistry , mostly due to the age differences , and i mostly felt sorry for ken watanabe and hoped his hollywood pay check compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious chairman . i remember more emotion in portrait of jennie as the young girl is anxious to grow up into jennifer jones to please joseph cotton . we see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with regular women as photographic attractions , and as an ageless ziyi zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation . the finale has little sense of normality . the score includes many chopped up traditional melodies , with cello by yo yo ma and violin by yitzhack pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation , that are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment to the lovely cinematography , as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting . as my mind wandered , i wondered how the great japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story , which probably would have been more formal , but a lot more emotional .",0,1

"michael caine has always claimed that ashanti was the only film he did purely for the money as well as the worst film he ever starred in . hold on , michael , weren't you in the swarm and hurry sundown ? and weren't both of those films a good deal worse than ashanti ? perhaps caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees fahrenheit temperatures the director , richard fleischer , was hospitalised as a result of sun stroke during the shoot . what ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low point of michael caine . instead , it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast , exotic locations , boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline . dr . david linderby caine is a w . h . o medic who is left devastated when his black wife anansa beverly johnson goes missing during an aid trip to an african tribal village . linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders led by suleiman peter ustinov and he sets off on a continent wide pursuit which eventually leads to the middle east . along the way , big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles . william holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot ; omar sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered arab millionaire ; rex harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists caine in his quest . the film is based on a best seller entitled ebano , by the little known author alberto vasquez figueroa , but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation . ustinov is charismatic as the slaver he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances , and caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he'll never see his wife again . there are occasional flashes of action , but on the whole ashanti is quite slow moving . all in all , it is a resistible piece of action hokum not by any stretch as awful as caine has frequently suggested , but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let down from all the talent involved .",0,1

"a remake of a successful movie can be a tricky business at best ; to remake a true classic , especially one that is veritably the definitive film of a director like alfred hitchcock , is something else again . and after watching this version of psycho , ' directed by gus van sant , two things come to mind immediately what's the point , and what on earth were they thinking ? especially in light of the fact that van sant used the same screenplay by joseph stefano , taken from the novel by robert bloch that hitchcock used . the final result here underscores some of the finer points of the art of filmmaking first , that a remake' should be just that ; a retooling of the original , rather than a copy' using new players ; and second , that shooting in color , using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film . although this was a noble effort by van sant , ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which norma bates was afflicted the mind' of the film was divided ; half was hitchcock , half van sant . and the twain , though met , shall never be bound . van sant , even working from the original script , would have been better off making his own film all the way through rather than attempting to duplicate exactly what hitchcock did with certain scenes . the opening shot of the movie , for instance , and especially the shower' scene , arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema . copying hitchcock , from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain , and using the same skree ! skree ! skree ! ' sound effects even as homage to hitchcock again , only distracted from the story . and , if you factor in the performance of william h . macy as private eye arbogast , you have yet another split in the psyche of the film . macy is a terrific actor one of the best character actors in the business and his performance here is excellent ; but as good as it is , the attitude and delivery are pure david mamet with whom he has worked many times , and seemingly out of context with what van sant is doing . so the film winds up with a triple personality disorder hitchcock , van sant and mamet . i felt like i was watching house of good will psycho games . ' as far as performances go , macy's was as solid as they come , and anne heche marion crane did a good job of creating an original character , escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of janet leigh . the weak links were viggo mortensen sam , who made marion's boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place ; and vince vaughn , who to put it as delicately as possible was simply awful as norman bates . his whole performance was that of an actor playing a role and not very convincingly at that ; affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with spontaneous' bursts of maniacal laughter made his norman more of a caricature than a character , altogether unbelievable and pretentious . it gave the movie the feel of a reenactment of a true incident' you would see on a television show ; it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from norman sitting alone in his parlor to a shot of a sober faced peter graves , intoning , such was the mind set of norman bates on that fateful , rainy night when marion crane stepped out of her car and into his life ' the supporting cast includes julianne moore lila , robert forster dr . simon , philip baker hall sheriff al chambers , anne haney mrs . chambers , chad everett tom cassidy , rance howard mr . lowery , rita wilson caroline , james remar patrolman and james legros charlie the car dealer . if nothing else , van sant's psycho' is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director , a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily insure a success . granted , todays era of psycho babble , american psycho' and hannibal lecter have effectively taken the edge off of a character like norman bates somewhat ; but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between norman , his mother and his victims that will forever remain inherently disturbing and terrifying ; but van sant is unable to convey that sense of dread , that throat clenching fear , with this film . if ever there was a movie made that should have been earmarked straight to video , this is it . better still , had it never been born . i rate this one 2 10",0,1

"when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following . the united states of america with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside . it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated . on a per capita basis europe , britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per capta basis the actual size of neo nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america . it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society . by doing so greenstreet , deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie . this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and clich idealist left wing ideology . this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition . greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies , the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy . movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash . sensationalism at its worst anti usa garbage shameful .",0,1
"a chicago couple , dillon and dougherty , are falsely accused of killing their daughter . people begin to wonder if they did it . the police investigate and find suspicious evidence . the couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press . the cops speculate that they are satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter . they are charged and brought to trial . they are represented by publicity seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for 100 , 000 . the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police . fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented . their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home . dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed . verdict , she didn't do it but he did . he goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years . in the last third of the movie , with dillon in jail and dougherty wondering what to do next , we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couple's defense . witnesses admit to having lied . other facts are brought to light that , finally , result in dillon's release . the killer is never found , though the movie gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perp . this is a weeper from beginning to end . nothing seems to go right for the couple . oh , there are a few happy moment , maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy , or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another . but it's never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief . usually a fade to block follows . there isn't necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies , although i can't imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer . there's plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too . i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they're told . oh , but i am fortune's fool ! romeo cries after killing juliet's brother . here we have dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor , screaming , where's my baby ? there isn't any ambiguity or irony in the story as i'm sure there must have been in the real life events on which it's based . people are either good or bad here . or else they're bad , then they turn good . the film isn't aimed at exploring human quirkiness , or the way things work out . it's aimed at wrenching tears from the audience . the actors provide first rate role models . i can't remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears . there are rivulets of tears . showers of them . cascades of them . a veritable niagara of them . a lake lacrymose of them . well , i'll give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted . dillon and dougherty hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator ed asner . asner is sympathetic to them but he doesn't really accomplish much . he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy learn to live with it , which is okay and because he suffers from colorectal cancer , so we can watch him take his medicine , double over with pain , and finally pass away . what's frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple , it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises the function of gossip in regulating private lives . gossip is a strange thing really . if we call it gossip it's bad , but if we call it public opinion it sounds acceptable , at the very least . of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified . as i write , michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy , and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile . but gossip isn't all bad either . it's like water . when it's properly controlled it's a community asset . we need gossip to keep each other in line . it helps us to maintain public order . but , like water in a flood or a tsunami , it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of control . this is a movie that's okay if you're not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature . it's done so cleverly that , given its goal , it's hard to argue with it .",0,1
"the often reliable leonard maltin says this is a delightful romance and that sanders is superb . maltin must have confused this movie with something else . sanders is snide and droll and superb , as usual , you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery , sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three , but dull , wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately . the storyline itself , an autobiography with sanders as a suave jewel thief , francois eugene vidocq , who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels , is entertaining enough , but it has the same kind of hollow historical hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as marie antoinette , and certainly the deplorable forever amber which screams for a classy remake . though , in his defense , sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character , it is all for naught . i am an unabashed douglas sirk fan , but this is 1946 , and it is one of sirk's earliest american efforts , lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid , breast heaving potboilers . sirk is just getting his feet wet here , and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with magnificent obsession , and hit his stride , bombarding us with such estrogen fests as all that heaven allows , written on the wind , and imitation of life . but scandal in paris is hardly his best work a relatively low budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming .",0,1
"as i sit back after watching wong kar wai's 1994 movie ashes of time more specifically the 2008 re edit and re release with the word 'redux' slapped on the end of the title i wonder what went wrong . i wonder why the film just didn't work out at all . i wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book . in particular , what was it about the film which dragged it down , and made it the director's worst film of his career ? well it's not too hard to figure out really . let me just say that it truly is a shame that kar wai so abruptly went down this hell hole of mediocrity and poorness in moviedom , especially considering the fact that in the same year he released chungking express , one of his enduring legacies and an absolutely sublime film . so what went wrong ? it would be suitable to consider ashes of time as somewhat of an experimental film . our director essentially places his own inimitable style of film making and places it in an entirely different setting , mood and atmosphere ; what results is a catastrophic film which is all over the place and simply does not work out . hence , it would be even wiser to call ashes of time a failed experiment . bold , audacious and innovative , but a failure nonetheless . let me elaborate . those who have seen the films of mr . kar wai , a hong kong born film auteur who's made his mark on the art house world since his debut in the late 80's , will know that there is an overriding aesthetic which binds all of his movies together ; essentially and frankly speaking , they're all colourful , thought provoking , amiable , subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life , love and loss . the same formula is transposed into ashes of time ; however , the regular setting of hong kong is ridden of , and in its stead we're placed into the setting of ancient china , and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clansmen . intertwined into this quasi adventure historical caper is the typical kar wai love story , this time involving an elegiac hit man who has moved to the middle of the desert , and is carrying out contract killings . however , i must stop myself there ; description of characters is a useless thing to do . why ? because not a single character in ashes of time is worth mentioning or nothing . what a bland cast , and what a waste of talent the case of ashes of time contains nearly all regular kar wai collaborators . not only that , but the film is essentially endless incessant rambling in a horrendous , almost non existent narrative structure . one of the main reasons why detractors of ashes of time berate it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever , let alone a semblance or an indication of one . you can definitely see what they're getting at , even from the first two , three minutes , maybe less , of the film . perhaps it's just the atypical setting of ancient china which is unaccustomed and inappropriate for kar wai's typical film making style . i like to think , however unfortunate it may be , that mr . kar wai just stuffed up big time here . one thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in ashes of time , albeit said compliment being starkly isolated , is another director trademark wonderful , colourful and blissful aesthetics . what joyous colour is composed on screen , what glorious textures are painted for us , and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie . we can at least take this as a sign that wong kar wai is still there at heart , and it's just the film which is so atypical , and buries his usually commendable nuance . although the visuals aren't enough for us to fully absolve kar wai for this disastrous venture , they're enough to make the film worthwhile and at least we don't walk out of the movie in a completely and totally cantankerous mood , now that there's something we can think of nicely . the film is essentially a 'wuxia art' film , following in the style of , say , legendary japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa . however , one thing differentiates kar wai's film from kurosawa's best , and that's that in the japanese director's films everything gels together and simply works . in ashes of time , nothing seems to work . kar wai's attempt to make a genuinely profound wuxia film , let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms , is a futile endeavour . kar wai claims that making ashes of time exhausted him , and that he needed time to clear his head . it must've certainly been a fatiguing effort on his behalf , as his exertions are embodied in the film and transferred to us directly i mean , just watching the film is an exhausting effort , and now i need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie going experience .",0,1
"you would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic . these three who also happen to be three favorites of mine , walk around in a daze , looking like they'd rather be any place , but there . the sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic . in these days of political correctness , a film about american pioneers and the travails of their westward migration is something not done now . it should have been better done back then . kirk douglas is a former united states senator who's heading a wagon train west to build a settlement in oregon's willamette valley . being he's an ex politician , he rates above the hoi ploi he's leading . the script calls for him to have not only a covered wagon , but a carriage to lead the train . you think that's ludicrous , you ought to see the whipping scene where douglas orders his black servant , played by roy glenn to whip him . i won't spoil it by saying what causes douglas to demand this of glenn , but trust me , it's bad . robert mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored . there was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between widmark and douglas , but mitchum just saunters through the film above it all . maybe the friction helped somewhat because the movie calls for douglas , a widower , to have an eye on mrs . widmark , played by lola albright . now she's the best looking thing in the movie . the film billing says introducing sally field . this was made in between her gidget and her flying nun days . she plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of mercy mcbee . we first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents wagon , legs akimbo and inviting . of course she gets taken up on her invitation . her character is something like what's found in every trailer park in america and then again what was a wagon train , but one large trailer park on the move . despite this film , sally field went on to a two oscar career . what that woman had to overcome . victor mclaglen's son andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess . shame on andrew mclaglen , he's certainly done better in his career . and so will you , unless you're a stargazer .",0,1
"this does give away some of the plot , by the way . a charlie brown christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value christmas and just enjoying the holiday . this , however , does not . it tries to capture the emotion of a charlie brown christmas , there even is another christmas play , but fails with lackluster and easy jokes . charlie brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for peggy jean 25 gloves . what ? . his sister sally is the most annoying character in the movie . here is one of her jokes sally wants to write a letter to santa , but doesn't know how to spell charlie for some reason he needs to be in her letter so instead decides to name him sam , because she knows how to spell sam . also , sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day hark ! she instead says hockey stick har har . if sally saying hark 12 times all oddly sounding exactly the same doesn't kill you , nothing will . peppermint patty and marcy are a large focal point , but that hardly makes it better . marcy is funny with her responses to patty , but patty is another story . she sounds like a boy which doesn't dispel the rumors and gets mad when she has to be the sheep in the play terrible baas and all . apparently she is the sheep every year , and is worried she will forget her lines lines she doesn't have . she is so worried she mentions it twice , one right after the other , and gets the same response . i'm assuming she must have short term memory loss , or something . lucy and linus are more welcome although linus still has annoying advice , but hardly amount to much air time . i'm sure schroeder isn't even in this one . all in all , it tries to be a parasite to the original , but compromised the message for a few quick laughs .",0,1
"i fully agree with the previous reviewer . there's no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy lamarr , and the focus of the film is on their relationship . hedy lamarr isn't at her best , and spencer tracy appears to be naive , simple and overly hopeful both in love and life ; an idealist role that played out best in 'boys town' . if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station . whoa . it's rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast . not the best acting on anybody's part . miscast and mismatched . story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent . hedy lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself , which is truly the best part of the film . spencer tracy can't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe , and the film doesn't come off as believable for at least that reason .",0,1
"i chose this movie because i was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl two boys . as i lived this situation and get lost in it , i hope a similar story would inspire me . my major concerns are why a how b the triangle forms ? why c how d the triangle degenerates ? a the movie offers a plain answer because it's better ! . b here , it's an open triangle the three share things together . mine was a closed one every ones knows the others but never the three are together or speak about the missing one c the movie doesn't offer spoken explanations but rather prefer visual emotional assumptions the end comes with sensuality , sexuality coming up in the triangle , or more accurately , when for one member , deep feelings are tied with intimacy , and , as for the latter and the former , they can be divided . i agree with that . d in the movie in my story , silence is the proof that something isn't well . and in a ironic and painful way , the tool for this sad times , is always the phone i lived this dreadful planned phone call call me back i wait you and when time comes , the phone is silent . a variation is also shown , when the line is connected but one refuses to speak all those scenes were very very hard to see for me . if the movie was a great help in that way , he got also a lot of flaws i zapped on the boy's family problems why the shower scene on the dvd cover is cut on the movie ? how mickael gets finally into the hotel ? is cl ment always seeing salom ? he says no but has her address ; and who is the girl with him in the bar his girlfriend ? how can she knows about the address ? what finally happens to vanessa the ring at the final shoot is a proof of engagement ? with whom ?",0,1
"the ultimate goal of big brother , that we know what to think before we think it , has been realized . is it some kind of miracle , or sinister joke , that people don mental straight jackets of their own volition , twist themselves into contorted shapes , and grin like apes ? movies , art , no longer risk the unknown , but are forgone conclusions , drained of life . the notorious bettie page is a bland case history , fit for a freshman college feminism course . its lesson is schematic , right angled and linear see how women are objectified , exploited , abused , then tossed on the trash heap , by a male dominated society . bettie page , supposedly , was the pin up queen of the 1950's , the ass millions of men ejaculated to . all reviewers repeat that phrase , pin up queen of the 1950's , like a choir of monkeys . her history as an american sex bomb is familiar southern , abused by her father , raped , etc . in this movie she is a na f , an innocent unaware of the prurient interests she serves and shamelessly profits from . although she believes in jesus , she enjoys frolicking nude before a camera lens just the wholesome girl next door sex slave american males supposedly fantasize . from the mouth of writer director mary harron herself , oxford educated and ex punker do you smell the combined rot of privilege and hipness as i do ? i feel that without feminism , i wouldn't be doing this . . i don't make feminist films in the sense that i don't make anything ideological . but i do find that women get my films better . what a cozy clique . the movie merely goes through the motions of telling the story of a human life , it's subject and purpose having been eulogized and interred well before the movie began . ms . page has a boyfriend , but we are shown next to nothing about their relationship . in fact , there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the film . one can't ignore its smug simplicity . in new york , where ms . page tries her best to fit into and appease a man's world , letting herself be tied up in the ropes of bondage and tightly laced into the black leather boots and bodices of s m , the movie is black and white . but down in miami , where she goes to get away from it all , gleefully takes off her clothes , and is photographed by a liberated female , the movie turns into color . like hell harron doesn't make feminist films , doesn't make anything ideological . ideology has become so internalized , so assumed , so programmed , that it's almost invisible . big brother must be smiling .",0,1
"rko was trying to boost its starlet joan fontaine when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong willed enough to make a doctor john beal come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer . tcm aired it as a stepping stone in the career of joan fontaine . fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job , nothing more , and john beal is okay as her love interest . but it's obvious that philip huston who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young james garner is the actor who should have shared top billing with fontaine . whatever happened to this handsome actor ? why didn't rko promote him , along with fontaine ? he showed skill as a light comedian . these are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as i watched this rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promise of its title . the story itself is rather tiresome , only occasionally coming to life because of fontaine's spirited heroine . she photographs prettily as the nurse and wears her serious expressions skillfully , suggesting that there was more to be tapped at a future date . beal never did go on to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why . strictly lackluster . but whatever happened to philip huston ? evidence here is that he should have had a worthwhile film career . trivia note watch for dwight frye of dracula as the out of control patient aboard the airplane .",0,1
"following the success of paris , je t'aime , a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york . unlike the original film , the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly by the time you think are getting into a story , it's over in too many cases . and , the often start up and stop and then begin again with the stories woven together . as a result , there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure . sadly , however , while paris , je t'aime was hit or miss mostly hit , most of new york , i love you was miss . the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet and often quite terrible . it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . now understand , it was good quality music but its somber tone really , really made me feel like cutting my wrists ! among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom , the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant though this was also in the first film and the crotchety old couple . this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much and i really wanted to love this film . i respected what they tried but simply didn't like it very much . by the way , and this is not really a complaint , but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . for a recent film , that was unusual in our more anti smoking culture . also , if you get the dvd , there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . one consists of kevin bacon wearing a cool fedora eating a hotdog . and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes . the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world including a very unhappy couple .",0,1

"when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers , it was films like the garden of allah . how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me . also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me . the garden of allah , one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911 12 . it then got two silent screen adaptions . the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world . he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent . she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train . the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer . i'm not sure what was in david o . selznick's mind in filming this story . someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience . but you can bet that the movie going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title . the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting . as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret . the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves . the monks are a sincerely pious group , but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest . anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts . most especially marlene dietrich . i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot .",0,1
"i was thrilled by the fresh pun intended synopsis of this film and looking forward to watch it . the first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place ; the gardening allotments . the movie looks fantastic . colorful yet simple . magical yet genuine . unfortunately , it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go . we quickly figure out this will be a manipulative , sappy tale illustrating a bunch of jaded people set in their ways confronted by nice victimized refugees and that it will have a happy ending where the jaded people realize the error of their ways and accept these people . the characters , particularly the prejudiced ones , are very comic booky in nature . the story focuses mainly on two refugee families . one of them is headed by a single mom played atrociously by diveen henry . i am saddened to say that any emotion that might have been felt toward her struggles were defused by what was memorably bad acting . the other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children . all are scarred by their journey to this country by way of containers , where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most . benedict wong gives a mind blowing performance here . at first , his emotions are very subdued but as the story develops , he subtly makes us aware of the inner struggles of his character . unfortunately , the rest of the movie is just extremely boring . there were so many possibilities with this movie . there are several characters to keep track of , many of which might have potential but none of it is realized . even worse , despite this movie being very much not hollywoodian , some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a hollywood b grade way . example character a likes character b character b rejects his advances no problem ! let's have character c declare her love for character a so we can all have a happy ending . yawn . i liked very much the plot thread of the asian family . that was well done . unfortunately , the whole allotment business , the communal aspect of it , the dynamic involving a large cast are all under exploited . what you're left with is a movie that has very little worth .",0,1

asks brennan . up on the pelly river . trouble with the chilkats , someone replies . he's got a real tough job , that constable . he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles . sometimes he don't get home for two or three months at a time . the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen . the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike . they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense . they collected customs duties , often over the wails of the new arrivals , made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation , and turned men back if they didn't have enough supplies , or if they simply looked bad . in true canadian fashion , they laid down moral laws for the community . in dawson the lord's day act was strictly observed ; it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday ; and plump young women were arrested for what the stern faced police called giving a risqu performance in the theatre , generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights . in such a community , a gunbelt was unthinkable . one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable , who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly . the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman , upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over . no man has yet taken a gun away from me , said the american . well , i'm taking it , the constable said mildly and did so , without further resistance . so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece . in 1898 , the big year of the stampede , there wasn't a serious crime let alone a murder in dawson . the contrast with skagway on the american side , which was a lawless town run by soapy smith , the denver confidence man , was remarkable . but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law , which a soapy smith character from skagway he is called gannon in the picture can easily control . in real life , one of smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant . in the movie the lone mountie says yes i'm the law . i represent the law in the yukon territory . about fifty thousand square miles of it . then why aren't there more of you ? because yesterday this was a wilderness . we didn't expect you to pour in by the thousands . now that you're here , we'll protect you . when ? there'll be a post established here in dawson early in may . what happens between now and may ? you going to be here to keep order ? part of the time . what about the rest of the time ? pick yourselves a good man . swear him in . have him act as marshal the movie mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture . his astonishing suggestion that an american town marshal , complete with tin star , be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under british jurisprudence is accepted . naturally they want to make jimmy stewart the marshal ; he clearly fits the part . but stewart is playing the role of the loner who looks after number one and so another man is elected to get shot . and he does . others get shot . even walter brennan gets shot . stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own . he pins on the tin star and he and the bully , gannon , blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax . to anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north , this bald re telling of the story passes rational belief . excerpt from hollywood's canada , by pierre berton , 1975 .",0,1
"i'm not really much of an abbott costello fan although i do enjoy who's on first and , to be honest , there wasn't much in this movie that would inspire me to watch any more of their work . it wasn't really bad . it had some mildly amusing scenes , and actually a very convincing giant played by buddy baer , but somehow , given the fame of the duo and the esteem in which they're generally held , i have to say i was expecting more . as the story goes , the pair stumble into a babysitting job , and during the reading of jack the beanstalk as a bedtime story with the kid reading it to costello , costello's jack falls asleep and dreams himself into the story . there's a wizard of oz kind of feel to the story , in that the characters in the dream are all the equivalents of real life acquaintances of jack , and the movie opens in black white and shifts to colour during the dream sequence . the fight scenes between jack and the giant and the dance scene between jack and polly dorothy ford are among the amusing parts of the movie . polly , of course , also leads to one of the questions of the movie what happened to her ? jack and gang apparently left her behind in the giant's castle ! i know it was just a dream , so who cares . still i wondered . there were also a couple of cute song and dance routines . my 4 year old giggled a bit during this , so she was able to appreciate some of the humour . i found it to be an acceptable timewaster , but certainly not anything that would convince you of abbott and costello as comic geniuses . 4 10",0,1
"as their entire career was a pale impersonation of the beatles , it is no surprise that , shortly after the great fiasco of the beatles magical mystery tour , the monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie , called head . both movies are not so much a true story with a plot though mmt attempted to define a plot as they are a hodge podge of skits and snippets , interspersed with music and songs and out takes . head has no plot , other than the pre fab four trying to break free of the box they are in i . e . the type casting of being monkees and the surrounding commercialism and yet , always finding themselves back in the box . most skits involve breaks in the fourth wall and crossing over into other , seemingly unrelated scenes . filled with anti vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents , the film bounces around haphazardly also to be blamed on the multiple directors . the film , like magical mystery tour , is now excused by some fans as wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements . phooey . like mmt , it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap . like mmt , head has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown monkees songs that are quite decent . it does develop a bit more charm than mmt and is a bit easier to sit through , but it is not ironic at all that , like everything else the monkees did , this was just a mimicry of something the beatles did first . even when it comes to laying an egg .",0,1
"no , it's not the horror movie . this one is actually a love story . the ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them . she loves the boxer known as one round jack . she loves him until the champion comes along , that is . even though she marries one round , she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion . she comes back to one round's corner , just when things look their bleakest , and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back . this film was very early in hitch's career , but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film . although there are special film tricks , and some comedy relief , this film just does not hold up to any of his later work . it must have been extremely risqu for the time period though , with the shameless adulterous wife . that may have been the draw back in 1927 . while looking through all of these old films , it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on today's screen and really come off . maybe i should be the one . skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcock's films . you could fall asleep in the middle .",0,1
"for me this movie was a disappointment . somehow i expected that it would explain the reason for general rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist in ww ii . but there is none of that , it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries , in a way , to whitewash him . so i just have to suppose that rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquering and killing business , without any particular charm or notoriety in behaviour . such real life people just do not make good movie material . i almost feel sorry for james mason , really one of my favorite actors , who had to impersonate a pretty wooden character . actually , a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie with the exception of luther adler who gives a really memorable and weirdly naturalistic portrayal of adolf hitler . there might also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the german speaking world . famous british actors impersonating germans are just not credible . rommel , for example , is perceived here not just as a german but as a typical southerner from baden w rttemberg . you immediately think of a certain dialect , a certain kind of wit , a certain way of seeing the world the total opposite of eg a prussian junker . i also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt of july 20th , many of those who were in on the conspiracy were not democrats and just wanted the german troops to join the western allies against the advancing bolsheviks thus prolonging the war forever . the best movie portrayal of an intellectual , intelligent military mind is in my opinion still patton 1970 . incidentally , general patton can be glimpsed for a short moment in the ample documentary footing used for this movie , a low angle shot while he is inspecting passing vehicles . the open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible !",0,1
"the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor , a holocaust survivor , part of mengele's experiments on twins , consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz , and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments . the movie obviously had great reviews . it's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about . i too , for a large part of the movie , got sucked into the emotion that the movie maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on . one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum could only find the sweetest nectar . in one of the many dramatic sequences , as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center , the meaning of the word forgive is even debated , but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own but by this time , the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more . after the strong willed eva kor forgives her nazi captors the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about , at least from the viewpoint of kor . the movie goes about following her , past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory . to me , this was the meat of the movie , surrounded by inedible fat of her act of forgiveness . obviously , it was a very sick cow . on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness , in order to heal wounds of the past , she makes her way to the promised land to meet with some arabs , to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis , including one at a jewish center in chicago . from then on , anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements . firstly , you immediately notice her body language , defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers . her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time , effort and money the entire act was . a rather annoyed dr sami advan professor of education at bethlehem university gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment . finally , the debate at the jewish center in chicago , where she is grilled on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so , in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts . i will cut to the chase . by the end of the movie , i was hoping i hadn't chosen to watch the movie . the movie was badly made , failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial , just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears . it showed that kor , the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion . her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness at best to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate . lastly , is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving ? quoting another imdb user , i don't see her forgiveness as being weak quite the contrary , she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul , she wanted the suffering to be over , so she let it go . that would be the perfect layman's definition of making peace . i guess , in a world of propaganda , blind faith and political correctness , there is no room to question those that have gone through more than the human mind can fathom . p . s . the dictionary certainly should go into all those books to buy lists everyone keeps making .",0,1
"this film was done in really poor taste . the script was really bad . i feel really sad for the late gregory peck who took on the title role of this b movie adaptation of one of history's greatest generals . the movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the japanese in world war 2 . there was a scene where i almost vomited , it showed macarthur in a bunker in corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded , one legged filipino soldier . the soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says no papa , no mama , no uncle sam' and macarthur gives his little pep talk that americans would never abandon' the philippines . the scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by macarthur's words and gives him a smart salute . i mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the u . s . as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake . it showed that filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great americans solely for redemption . it blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the usaffe united states armed forces of the far east , these are filipino volunteers that were integrated in the us military during world war 2 , who died side by side with the americans fighting the japanese , who walked side by side with americans in the death march of bataan and defended corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after macarthur left for australia with his famous i shall return' speech . my late grandfather , a filipino world war 2 veteran and usaffe soldier was one of the many who fought the japanese with honor and love for the home country . i think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the leyte gulf landing .",0,1
"combining serious drama with adequate comedy is touchy at the best of times . looking for comedy in the muslim world pulled it off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script ; not to mention albert brooks' excellent broodish character portrayal . but man of the year can't come close by comparison . it has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable . the premise initially seemed very promising . put a jon stewart like comedy news guy up for president of the united states and see what happens . this independent runner is tom dobbs robin williams , rv , a successful tv personality who is pressured into running by his audience . along with him comes his manager jack christopher walken , click , and his writer eddie lewis black . seeming to have very little chance at a successful run , tom dobbs amazingly wins the election . but did he ? eleanor green laura linney , the exorcist of emily rose is a computer whiz at the company who designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations . she finds a glitch in the system that is quickly swept under the rug by the company's owner and his dark attorney alan jeff goldblum , independence day . poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out , the company's evil men decided to discredit and or kill eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone . but eleanor is able to get to president elect dobbs and finally spill the beans this is where the unbelievable love story starts blossoming , too . dobbs goes onto saturday night live and explains everything to the world , thus removing himself as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those at the computer company . oh , and saving ms . green's life . does any of this sound funny ? the comedy is forcefully wedged into the story and is often awkward . robin williams blazes for a few moments during a debate but is quickly doused as the gravity of how he became president bears down on him . the message of the film is interesting and debatable , too that special interest owns presidential candidates . i'm sure there's substantial truth in this , and if you wanted to make a movie about it you could . if you wanted to make a comedy about you could . but man of the year isn't it .",0,1
"it seems a shame that greta garbo ended her illustrious career at the age of 36 with this ridiculous mistaken identity marital romp . coming off the success of her first romantic comedy , ernst lubitsch's masterful ninotchka 1939 , where she was ideally cast as an austere russian envoy , garbo is reunited with her leading man melvyn douglas for a sitcom level story that has her playing karin borg , a plain jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive larry blake when he becomes smitten with her . once he makes clear that work is his priority , karin inadvertently decides to masquerade as her high living twin sister katherine to test her husband's fidelity when he is back in manhattan . it's surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by george cukor , who led garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in 1937's camille , because this is as unflattering a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend . only someone with carole lombard's natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by the numbers script by s . n . behrman , salka viertel and george oppenheimer . mgm's intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and americanize garbo's image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirties . however , garbo appears ill at ease mostly as the bogus party girl katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like douglas and constance bennett as romantic rival griselda . photographed unflatteringly by joseph ruttenberg , garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the chica choca dance sequence . the story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of sonny bono's death . roland young and ruth gordon in a rare appearance at this point of her career show up in comic supporting roles as douglas' associates . this movie is not yet on dvd , and i wouldn't consider it priority for transfer as it represents a curio in garbo's otherwise legendary career . she was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming . i can see why .",0,1

"i'm a huge fan of both emily watson breaking the waves and tom wilkinson normal and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett dellamorte dellamore in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more . the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid , infinitely entitled , worthless son of a rich lord are spot on and entertaining . but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone . the music was annoyingly movie of the week quality , and the voice over jarring and totally unnecessary . clearly the work of a first time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't sufficiently heed good advice . too bad . i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end , and vice versa , so there is some sort of character arc , at least in terms of perception . for example , watson's character , while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man , began to grate on me near the end , particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions , and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat , with no asking of permission , no apologies offered . and i went from disliking wilkinson's control freak moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wife . this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a love story or steel magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact , so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed was it the lord driving the car ? the lord's dog ? . the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is , the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for , florence nightingale incarnate , etc . was ok until he started over the top sobbing like a baby . good god ! if you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands , and so she drives her hard working , well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama . her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life ; the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach . look , everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary , who seemed to appreciate him for who he was . instead he acted like an abused dog , his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him . i'm not anti pc or anything , it just didn't ring true , even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face . the ending for me was and not the director's intention i am certain depressing . the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together , so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing . i'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story , it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed . is that asking too much ? my score 4 10",0,1

"it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy but scratchy background score that accompanies this 1933 release . although sound came into general use in 1928 , there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman , unhappily married , who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods . the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town , proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover . in a frenzy of jealousy , he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment , losing his nerve . it's probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story . hedy lamarr is given the sort of close up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer , but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood . her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love aribert mog , the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim . the swimming scene is very brief , discreetly photographed , and not worth all the heat it apparently generated . the love making scene , later on , is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film artfully so . more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece . not so . it's disappointing , primitively crude in its sound portions including the laborious symphonic music in the background and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b . mayer saw the film and on the basis of it , gave her a career in hollywood . he must have seen something in her work that i didn't . it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work . the jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed . it fails to end the film on the proper note .",0,1

"dear me . peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been . but his choice of films , say , after 1964 , was very unfortunate . he didn't seem to realize how to use his talents . he would have been better off working with more of the kubricks of the film world than the people he did . of his later films , only the optimists of nine elms and being there have impressed me of those i have seen . that said , the boultings and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad i have yet to see carlton browne and heavens above ! at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree . but , there's a girl in my soup really is a poor film and a dire choice on sellers' part in terms of character . in his films from 1955 64 , you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles . here , you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead . it's almost sellers playing a niven cad without the joviality . he certainly does not convince , try as he might , or create an interesting character . he should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as cary grant , and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for . hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry ; this is no easy , genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy . it is very artificial seeming , all the way through i know that it is part of danvers' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies , but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces . sellers has a very grating way of playing charm as well . this character really has no depth , and really does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest . sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty , iconoclastic performance in lolita . there really is nothing to say about the plot , direction or characters , as frankly they leave little or no impression . this is truly one of the most anaemic , complacent , misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen . a nonentity of a vehicle for sellers' undisputed talents . rating 1 2",0,1

"this game was terrible . i think they worked too hard on the visuals and didn't do much with the gameplay , which is the most important part . i mean , the visuals look incredible , but is the game really fun ? no ! i mean it's like hey let's jump off buildings and all i'm doing is holding up and a x . the game play just isn't there , and i don't agree with what ubisoft did , because they had this hot girl the producer of the game , jade raymond , and they were like ok we've got this hot girl , let's pimp her and if you go to gaming websites , you're not gonna see gameplay stuff of assassin's creed , you'll see her face with a microphone and it'll be like we interviewed jade raymond about her favorite cookies ! it's like man , shut the f k up who cares ? ! apparently . a lot of people do , because they bought the game and like it . i mean compare this game with super mario galaxy . a wii game that really doesn't abuse the wii remote , but still is very innovative and delivers in the most important part , gameplay ! they were able to do a bit of everything with mario galaxy , the graphics were still stunning , the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing , and that's a game that deserves game of the year . not assassin's creed , man , it doesn't even deserve to even be a nominee for game of the year . the hype around this game where it was like oh it's the next generation of gaming . really ? i think not ! so let me get this straight here , because i think the people liking this game are only liking it because they're jade fans , so i'll tell you guys , jade will not make out with you or anything if you love or defend this game ! if you want a real game on the ps3 , get uncharted drake's fortune , if you want a real game for the xbox 360 , get call of duty 4 and a ton of other games too , and if you want a real game just in all the systems ? get super mario galaxy ! i know this comment will be hated by many , but seriously , pressing two buttons for doing all this cool stuff , is that really a fun game ? the only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after it'll end up being more innovative and fun . and this game just isn't it . 1 . 3 10 a living hell !",0,1

"the ealing comedies constitute their own specific sub genre in the history of film . they were wry , droll reflections on british life in the late forties and early fifties . they are always amusing but i feel it is misleading to characterise them as comedies . they are breezy and good humoured , rather than laugh out loud funny . however , the best of them are laced with understated satire and shot through with an occasional dark streak epecially kind hearts and coronets and the ladykillers . i have an affection for all of them , but the lavender hill mob is probably the one i have most difficulty with . compared to the others , it seems somewhat perfunctory . to me , it is an outline sketch for a movie , but one that needed to spend a lot more time in development before it was ready to go before the cameras . everything about it is a bit undercooked . for example , nobody is given any real context or background . henry is simply a dutiful drudge , whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions go unrecognised , while albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by making gift shop trash for a living . this establishes a motive for their crime , but nothing that subsequently happens is a consequence either of their characters or their plan . other characters are introduced but play no real part in the story . the elderly resident in henry's guest house could with her love of detective stories have been made an unwitting thorn in his side , but is merely used as background 'colour' . similarly , the various policemen who pop in and out of the action are simply there to keep the plot ticking along . as a result , the movie is driven entirely by its contrived plot devices , which i find both frustrating and faintly irritating . the not very ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems , despite albert being prevented from carrying out his part in the plan by sidney tafler's clayton . the gold is then smuggled to france without mishap . everything would have gone smoothly if it wasn't for a minor hitch , lamely based on the french pronunciation of the letter 'r' , which results in six of the gold eiffel towers being accidentally sold to some english schoolgirls . this leads to a series of frantic chases as henry and albert seek to retrieve them . these scenes are well executed , but at each point the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of the schoolgirls by a series of wholly factitious accidents . it is as if god is deliberately intervening to give them a hard time . this kind of plotting always has me grinding my teeth . when they finally track the last eiffel tower to a police academy exhibition and snatch it from under the nose of john gregson's police inspector why is he there , anyway ? all shreds of plot logic are abandoned . the final car chases are then simply filling up screen time until we are returned to the framing device with which the picture began . the movie doesn't even bother to tell us the fate of albert stanley holloway , lackery sid james and shorty alfie bass . this genial little caper has the professionalism of the ealing team behind it , so it is far from being a bad movie . i suspect most viewers will find it considerably more enjoyable than i do and why shouldn't they ? , but i cannot help thinking there was a much better movie waiting to be made , if only more time and effort had been expended on fleshing out both the characters and the story . by the standards established by ealing , lavender hill mob is a missed opportunity . ps one curious footnote is that audrey hepburn gets a credit for her single line early on , but archie duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution . i guess she just had a better agent .",0,1
"hollywood had a long love affair with bogus arabian nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time . the most memorable were the jon hall , maria montez films which have long since become camp . this one is filled with dubbed songs , anachronistic slang , and slapstick . it's a truly bounteous crop of mesopotamian corn , and pretty near intolerable today . it was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age , consisting mainly of trick photography . the only outstanding , positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity . sad to say , of the many films made in this genre , few of them come up to alexander korda's original thief of baghdad . almost any other arabian nights film is superior to this one , though . it's a loser .",0,1

"i love musicals , all of them , from joyous oklahoma , to poignant porgy and bess , to the touching romantic damn yankees . and i know most of the songs , sometimes singing them spontaneously , with a crowd or humming them alone . in a real musical , as differentiated from this vaudeville show , every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment . it is an expression of sadness , regret , love , joy or exaltation a natural extension where mere words fail . so , in guys and dolls , my time of day describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman . every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood , or develops a character , creating a phantasmagoria of place , turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song . for this lover of the broadway musical , and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century , mama mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre . there , the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate , often delightful , plot lines . while here , the songs , simply picked up from a collection , only interfered with the shaky premise of the film . perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century musicals . they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love , as achieved in sweet charity . let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review . perhaps , another day , another mood , i could have gotten into it , and not have been so critical in this review . but i can't help but imagining what richard roger , oscar hammerstein , cole porter , irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise . i think about it , while the memories of seeing this film is fresh , and i can not help but to mourn the great loss .",0,1
"this is among one of many usa attempts of remaking a old classic british tv show , that's more famous than this one . from what i see none of you haven't mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a tv 50's 60's called secret agent man the original secret agent man starred the great patrick mcgoohan the prisoner , braveheart , ice station zebra , the phantom , etc a man who was tapped to be the first james bond , but he turned it down because mcgoohan was a very devout man and he considered james bond's bed hopping and violent ways to be against his values . this show was done in black and white , and it's a pity for those who haven't seen it , you are missing out on a lot . the character mr . mcgoohan played in secret agent man was named drake , and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial tv series called the prisoner . the character he played in the prisoner was that of a agent who's identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him . what he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the british secret service , and on this island the populace don't have names but they are referred to by numbers and patricks character is assigned a number which is 6 it was argued that his prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in secret agent man but mcgoohan himself disputed this . ofourse there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original secret agent man spawned . it was written by johnny rivers a famous 50's and 60's pop musician and from what i read some of you are actually think that the song comes from this version of the show . you're very wrong about that . it was johnny's and it comes from the original tv series so let me help to set the facts straight . to those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid , well in england , it was actually called danger man and in the us it was retitled secret agent man for such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first aired . granted this current show has little to do with the original , no such main character named drake in this one , and i guess they did their best to make this show their version of secret agent man . but it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series .",0,1

"when george c . scott played the title role in patton , you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist , shooting at german dive bombers with a revolver , and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike . the most action we get from gregory peck as macarthur , a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment , is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his . comparing peck's performance with scott's may be unfair . yet the fact macarthur was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels , as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at west point . it's clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that oscar winning film of a few years before . but while peck looks the part more than scott ever did , he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a wikipedia walkthrough of macarthur's later career . to this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived , an opening title crawl tells us . it's a typical dishwater bit of post vietnam sophistry about those who led america's military , very much of its time , but what we get here is neither view . macarthur as presented here doesn't anger or inspire the way he did in life . director joseph sargent , who went on to helm the famous turkey jaws the revenge , does a paint by numbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use as when the chinese attack u . s . forces in korea , while the script by hal barwood and matthew robbins trots out a macarthur who comes across as good natured to the point of blandness , a bit too caught up in his public image , but never less than decent . here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the phillipines . there you see him addressing congress in his old soldiers never die speech . for a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in toyko , waiting for the north koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details japan's rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule . peck's co actors , marj dusay as his devoted wife you're my finest soldier and nicolas coaster as a loyal aide , burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companion's magnificence but garner no interest on their own . even when he argues with others , peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence . when admiral nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the philippines , a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for macarthur , macarthur comes back with the comment just now , as i listened to his plan , i thought i saw our flag going down . doubtless the real nimitz would have had something to say about that , but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of president roosevelt . the only person in the movie who macarthur seriously disagrees with is harry s truman , who ed flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble toucan sam . truman's firing of macarthur should be a dramatic high point , but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation , in which peck plays macarthur as nothing less than a genial martyr . i've never been sold by peck's standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars ; he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best known roles . but it's unfair to dock him so much here , as he gets little help defining macarthur as anything other than a speechifying bore . except for two scenes , one where he rails against the surrender of the philippines he struck old glory and ran up a bedsheet ! and another where he has a mini breakdown while awaiting the u . s . invasion of inchon , inveighing against communists undermining him at the white house , peck really plays peck here , not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet american caesar . the real macarthur might have been worthy of such a comparison . what you get here is less worthy of shakespeare than shakes the clown .",0,1

"the broadway musical , a chorus line is arguably the best musical in theatre . it's about the experiences of people who live for dance ; the joys they experience , and the sacrifices they make . each dancer is auditioning for parts in a broadway chorus line , yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite . the film version , though , captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show , and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical , as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance , whatsoever . the biggest mistake was made in giving the director's job to sir richard attenborough , whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for gandhi . why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place ? which brings us to the next problem . a chorus line takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes . it's the least flashy of broadway musicals , and its simplicity was its glory . however , that doesn't translate well to film , and no one really thought that it would . for that reason , the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers , and should have left the theatre and audition process . the singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet , jazz or tap class . heck , they could have danced down broadway in their lively imaginations . yet , not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film , as attenborough's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction . many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director michael douglas whether he wants to hear them or not . douglas' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear , and to whom he has no patience . while the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play , some heretical changes were made . the very beautiful hello twelve , hello thirteen , hello love a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence was removed and replaced with the dreadful , surprise , a song so bad that it was nominated for an oscar . adding insult to injury , surprise simply retold the same story as hello , love but without the wit or pathos . there is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what not to do when transferring a broadway show to film . if you want to see a film version of this show , the next closest thing is bob fosse's brilliant all that jazz . while fosse's daughter is in a chorus line , he is the fosse who should have been involved , as director . he would have known what to do with this material , which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort .",0,1
"franco rossi's 1985 six hour italian mini series of quo vadis is a very curious beast , creating an absolutely convincing ancient roman world shot in matter of fact fashion very few long shots , no big cityscapes , but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the background . the shifting structure much of episode one is played out via voice over letters and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding , and certainly far too often uninvolving , but it has something going for it . the two main strengths are the characterisation of petronius a thankfully dubbed frederic forrest , whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that he's become incapable of experiencing emotion , and klaus maria brandauer's unique take on nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his 'audience' will receive it . elsewhere , max von sydow briefly appears in a few episodes , being rewarded with the show's most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave rome . it's the kind of thing the show could do with more of , but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional , inspiring or exciting moment under it's relentlessly low key direction . unfortunately francesco quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero , blending in with the walls and coming over less as a roman officer than that quiet , slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties you know , the one who you think is called dave or something like that . the budgetary limitations are very visible once its meet the lions time for the christians and ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends . not a trip i can particularly recommend , i'm afraid , but if you do embark on it it's one not entirely without its small rewards .",0,1
"the third film based on charles belden's play entitled mystery of the wax museum 1933 targets generation x tasy . twin screenwriters , chad hayes and carey w . hayes , spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies a promising start . their condition guarantees an authentic point of view . the role of paige paris hilton was not much of a stretch for the world's favorite heiress . she peruses in style , stripteases boys , chats on a cell , and frets over an ill conceived pregnancy . her regular routine has been altered beyond repair . hilton reached the peak of her performance not so hot during the 1 night in paris 2004 parody . while the pimp my ride is in motion , she zealously looks for lip balm in her boyfriend's robert ri'chard lap . finally , the actress atones for using the n word on the sex tape . director jaume collet serra molds his take on the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past . each exhibited opposite characteristics back then , whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the womb today . however , the latter does not rule out the former . childbirth constitutes the luck of the draw . spectators can hardly consider vincent brian van holt a contemporary quasimodo . granted , the recluses share some similarities such as artistry , disfigurement , submissiveness , and murder . yet , one small variable between the two makes all the difference . vincent is even uglier on the inside than he is on the out . collet serra's house of wax pays homage to actor vincent price from the first remake in 1953 . the film leaves obvious van gogh puns to the imagination of the audience . still , the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end . professor henry vincent price jarrod's unmasking receives runner up , but the most terrifying one in horror movie history belongs to lon chaney in phantom of the opera 1925 . as far as the new contender is concerned , the aftermath of separation surgery downplays the effect . a surgeon should know operating on siamese twins scars them physically and psychologically . their father needs to call a couple colleagues dr . phil to consult and dr . mcnamara to nip tuck . despite what the trailers said , wax is not forever . in fact , you can rid yourself of it by burning it .",0,1
"like the previous commentator on this film , i too found myself in tears at times during this movie . sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe inspiring awfulness comes into existence . from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses what irish emigrant hasn't had that one , its clear we are in trouble . and it doesn't get much better . whisked back to 1950s ireland , we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation , and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war . schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war . the drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their civil war allegiances . remembrances are carried out for those who died in the civil war . the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget . the civil war . every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the civil war . the blurb on the videocover of broken harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern ireland . the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic house prices . if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into ireland's obsession with its past , it fails miserably . it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its legacies . however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche . for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland it doesn't . 1950s ireland was a horrible , poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves . however there was more than one topic of conversation .",0,1

"not to be confused with michael ritchie's nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof , this smile is a down turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell . the film parallels two stories an impoverished chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially deformed orphan named ling yi ding , and a tv spawned malibu family act out gidget get birth control . katie mika booram , the third olsen twin plays a spoiled , self absorbed high schooler distanced from reality . her teacher sean astin paves the way for a school trip to china aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children . the film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating ling like the frankenstein monster . kramer continually masks her deformity through hats , hoods and camera placement . this approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material . she may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and kramer's answer is to cover her up until the big reveal . why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness ? we see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip . it is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live ; what is imperative is ling being equally as hot and popular as katie . funding for the film came from a trust established by the late roy rogers and dale evans . they envisioned a heritage of quality family films . give me son of paleface any day .",0,1

"when they announced this movie for tnt i was excited . a travesty from donald westlake's enough was one of my all time favorite stories . after i watched it i was not all that thrilled . recently i had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt , and once again i was disappointed she didn't like it much either , and she'd never read the book . in this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush . a big part of the problem was william h . macy . i like him fine in other films , but he played terry carey thorpe as a stammering , incompetent yutz . in the book thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves , but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun . spoilers follow they also left out a big part of the story other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy , where thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police . this is important not just because it's funny , but because it helps set up the relationship between fred and thorpe . in the movie fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting , because they don't seem all that close . in the book they become pretty good friends especially on fred's side , which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges thorpe's downfall . fred also suffered a bit from casting , i love adam arkin but he was not a cheerful , happy to be alive upbeat sort of detective , character traits which book fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking . patricia and edgarson were pretty close to the book , and james cromwell was great despite not looking much like martin balsam . the whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding edgarson's body after thorpe ships it to seattle and blaming the death on the mob . kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten , and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying . i don't mind changes to books to make movies , i know they are necessary because of length and difficulty , but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller .",0,1

"loosely based on novels by earl derr biggers , 20th century fox's charlie chan series proved an audience favorite but when japan attacked pearl harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its asian hero . this was a miscalculation actor sidney toler took the role to poverty row monogram studios , where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947 . 20th century fox had regarded the chan films as inexpensive b movies , but even so the studio took considerable care with them the plots were often silly , but the pace was sharp , the dialogue witty , and the casts which featured the likes of bela lugosi and ray milland always expert . the result was a kindly charm which has stood the test of time . monogram was a different matter chan films were b movies plain and simple . little care was taken with scripts or cast and resulting films were flat , mediocre at best , virtually unwatchable at worst . thanks to an adequate cast and a few interesting plot devices , the shanghai cobra is among the best of the monogram made chan films but even so it barely manages to achieve a consistent mediocrity . in this particularly entry , chan sidney toler is called upon to investigate a murderer who kills with what appears to be a cobra like bite ; at the same time , he decides to make certain that a government supply of radium tucked away in a bank vault , of all places , remains secure . do these two seemingly unrelated plot lines come together ? well . could be ! sidney toler is always enjoyable as chan , but most of his monogram performances seemed phoned in and that is as true of cobra as it is of any monogram chan film . as usual , the really enjoyable performer is mantan mooreland . changing times have led us to look upon moreland's brand of comedy as demeaning to african americans , but he was an expert actor and comic , and taken within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has tremendous charm and innocence . fans of the 20th century fox series are likely to find monogram's chan a significant disappointment and newcomers who like the monogram films will probably consider them third rate after encountering the fox films . like other monogram chan films , the shanghai cobra is best left to determined collectors . four stars , and that's being generous . gft , amazon reviewer",0,1
"life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers . such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for ; but to be effective they must also be entertaining . unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read ; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round . the first such work to become really widely known was probably george orwell's 1984 first published in 1948 , and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film . watch or read it and then , when you are feeling a little depressed by man's inhumanity to man , reach for cinderella 2000 . this is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing ; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period . most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments . to exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a dvd or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption . there are many worse films appearing as dvd's these days , and frankly i do not care much what happens either way . so far the best of the films of this genre has probably been the handmaiden's tale , but i would very happily swap them all for a well made film of jack london's towering novel the iron heel . ambitious as this would be , it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it imdb only lists a b w silent version made in russia in 1919 .",0,1

"a thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims , along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine , and here susan lucci performs as a siren , although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one . isabelle lucci , inconstant wife of venture capitalist stewart collins john o'hurley , begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman richard davis philip casnoff , simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for richard , apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent . when davis becomes convinced that guileful isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband , he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself , coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent stewart . in the wake of the hit man's assault upon collins , a pair of police detectives , performed by joe grifasi and dean mcdermott , become increasingly curious concerning isabelle's possible involvement in the crime , while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering . lucci and kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators , each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds , but o'hurley and mcdermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements . released upon a fremantle dvd , this largely lustreless affair depicting a man 'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top flight visual and sound quality , and although no extra features are provided , the above average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer robert primes and composer stephen edwards .",0,1
"this film is a great disappointment . director vicente aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career , some of them were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by spanish actress victoria abril . in juana la loca , he relies on a gifted actress as well , newcomer pilar lopez de ayala , but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie . while lopez de ayala tries hard to portray juana as a romantic and passionate young woman , completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband , it seems as if she weren't able to develop her character over this one dimensional feature ; juana was an important figure in spanish history , and politics of that time were essential in her storyline . but here she's introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera ; this is a real pity , and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence history and vice versa . worst of all , italian actors daniele liotti and manuela arcuri turn out in real bad performances , which , in the case of liotti is a real problem as he portrays felipe el hermoso , a pivotal role in this story . it seems a clear choice to attract young audiences , as both of them look like top models of this era . on the other hand , talented actors such as giuliano gemma and rosana pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped . even if this was a big budgeted film , little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating period pieces on the screen . costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes , as if they were taken from stock material , without regarding of a real coherence . all in all , the main problem with juana la loca and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as la reine margot or elizabeth is the lack of a director's point of view . this a strange turn in aranda's career , as he was able to develop it in other works libertarias and amantes come to my mind , creating very personal and interesting movies , while this juana really is no more than a routine academic historical piece . and a not very good one at that !",0,1

"there's something rotten about this film , and basically the way it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by exploiting our sympathy with his admittedly horrible situation . sampedro , like many who have lost hope , chooses suicide . the fact that he has been contemplating it for more than 26 years probably makes his condition worse , but the belief that we should do whatever anyone asks , even if it means ending a life is in my opinion profoundly wrong . what a contrast to the uplifting example of the scientist stephen hawkings , who suffered a far worse condition for far longer ! yet with the morals upside down , the film revels in hero worship , and the people who disagree with are painted in simplistic idiotic terms . there's little room for subtly especially in the encounter with the priest deliberately manipulating the real life encounter which was with a much younger priest . in that way i suppose the film is on a par with riefenstahls triumph of the will . the insidious idea is that everyone should have to right to take their life , when they feel they cannot live it anymore . it makes no difference whether you are physically or psychologically damaged , there are people evidently who believe you have the right to choose . the same people are likely to make a case for abortion . its all part of the current trend to get the suffering or sufferers out of sight , brush it under the carpet , mammy will say its . ok , and we all feel very happy with ourselves . so we go down the slippery path of believing that some lives , just ain't worth living , and then we'll decide that as some people can't really decide for themselves then we'll bring in the state to decide for them . enter adolf hitler straight from that other oscar contender der untergang . hitler of course believes that he carrying out exactly what nature does in disposing of the weak . under his regime , there were forced abortions among the weaker strains , the mentally handicapped were quietly put away and the jews were humanely liquidated by using gas . he would have applauded this film , and why not for it is in line with his philosophy . some lives are just not worth living . i differ from ramon sampedro , hitler and all the people involved with making this film . human life is sacred , it is not a right , it is a gift and an obligation . nobody chooses to be born . then who can choose death . its not about religion , its about protecting the weak and helpless , something this film does a lot to undermine !",0,1

"i started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated jane austen fan i persevered through to the end . however , this is not a programme i would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as i don't think it does the book justice , nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right . there was something about this adaptation that lacked believability many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and i found the acting to be , at times , poor . there is no doubt that the actors were all very good looking , but this didn't provide enough variety to create really diverse , memorable characters . it was far too static being set entirely in the same location and missing out fanny's return home , which is one of the most interesting parts of the story . the best actor was blake ritson , who captured the wholesomeness of edmund very well , and the crawfords were effectively cast too . i do like billie piper as an actress , but this role did not suit her and was much better played by frances o'connor in the 1999 version who gave overall a far more subtle and convincing performance . jane austen adaptations will always provide a love story to leave you feeling good but unfortunately , this is one of the worst i have seen .",0,1
i have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written . the acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it . in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer . i am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit dead like me where she plays the role of daisy adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner . i remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader . i felt as though if anyone might make it from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique nordic blond allure . if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'godfather' or perhaps 'beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low budget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying it's a start !,0,1

"the figure of empress elizabeth of austria 1837 1898 is , indeed , mostly associated with romy schneider and the sissi trilogy by ernst marischka 1950s where beauty , gentleness , sweetness but also history are ever present . this was the sissi , perhaps myth for some ; however , a powerful portrayal . the spirit of the habsburgs' grandeur as well as the spirit of the bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness influenced much those films . simply , they did have a soul . however , jean daniel verhaeghe's film , though made 50 years later , appears to be a wrong depiction of the empress and her life . it seems to be an attempt to show something different , to reveal some realism as a cure to sweetness ; yet , it does not occur to add a lot but rather deprives the whole story of much . let me analyze that in more details . september 1898 , sissi embarks at the port of geneva . accompanied by her court maid , she goes to visit dr mayer didier bezace whom she is going to tell the whole life story in order to find herself in this tragic life . the action consists of flashbacks to important moments in sissi's life , yet these moments are chaotically presented and , therefore , someone not very knowledgeable of austrian history may get totally misled or confused . much attention is drawn on sissi's bad marriage with the emperor franz josef . the scene of her wedding night is a failure . no one treated an empress like that i mean undressing and payment . the focus on sissi being misunderstood is right historically , however , the points that her views differ from the rest of the courtiers' are not the true ones . where is her desire for peace ? where is her love to her nation ? where is her charity ? sissi appears to be rather very elegant , modern , liberal from the 21st century's point of view . she foremost cares for her looks which is not true historically . sissi had an inner life which is not showed in the film . once women will wear trousers is a sentence said by her and occurs to be the image of the sissi presented in the movie . sissi detests monarchy , which is the film's noticeable criticism towards austrian empire . moreover , she partly accepts anarchist movements and , to my very surprise , she blames her husband , emperor franz josef , for the death of rudolph , their son . where is any mention in history that sissi was present in mayerling ? sissi's relation with sophie , the mother in law , is better shown , however the scene of sophie's death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit of clich . sorry to criticize so much but another crucial aspect of the movie which i find weak here are performances . although arielle dombasle has her moments as sissi , she generally does not suit to the role . she looks more like a femme fa tale than a tragic empress . her make up is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures as the empress . malik zidi is a bit better as rudolph and may be regarded as the one raising the value of the performances , in general . yet , stephane audran does no special job as sophie you simply don't get the impression of why she detests sissi . she did despise her for the sake of sissi's young age while crowned , for the sake of her behavior , lifestyle and her believes . partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough . but the greatest mistake is , i think , julien hans capua as andrassi . andrassi was a count with pride , honor , patriotism . here , he appears to be a sort of libertine thinking only to make love to his queen . and the portrayal is so weak that this performance is very very pale . the accurate choice is tatyana ivanova as catherine schratt , she really fits to the role with her looks and her gestures . but , unfortunately , her role does not require much time on screen . a good point of this movie are some costumes and pretty authentic locations . the port of geneva is well presented and the moment of sissi's death occurs to be a good surprise from the movie . it does not appear to be how it really was ; however , the moment is good from the symbolical perspective . the empress walks and knows nothing that this is her final moment . that is how she must have felt about it , that is how one insane man destroyed a part of greatness of the world . another good moment visually was when sissi talks to her son rudolph on corfu . but these moments are rare . in sum , it's not a good film . it distorts a very eminent historical figure , a significant historical time , it tries to cure the sweetness of sissi trilogy but appears to offer nothing creative . charm is gone , grandeur is gone and history is ignored ! not very worth seeking out ! 3 10",0,1

"director delbert mann was a much better director than this film indicates . he directed all quiet on the western front , that touch of mink , and the last days of patton among others . this mediocre , made for television retelling of dicken's masterpiece is so bad , even those unfamiliar with the often filmed tale , will be unsatisfied . besides the fact that the movie is available from only two known suppliers brentwood and bci eclipse llc the poor quality of the transfer , and the scratchy and muddied sound track make the task of finding this film on video not worth the effort . i have always believed that if a company is going to put a film on video and charge the public money to buy it , then they should at least have a descent copy of the film and do a good job on the transfer . unfortunately neither of the two suppliers have such a work ethic and the result is only fit for the bargain bin in the local discount store . the story is told mainly through flashbacks , making the film episodic and talky . much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation . the characters of martha , traddles and others have been cut and the relationship of young david and steerforth is not explored enough , so we are left wondering why david would hang out with the guy . the relationship between david the boy , and young agnes is never developed and it is hard to understand why she and david eventually marry . since martha is left out , it is a mystery how dan peggoty finds his niece . and the absence of traddles makes david a very lonely fellow . some have credited this film with doing a good job of abridging the lengthy novel . i disagree , this is at best a hatchet job on the book . anyone who has seen the 1935 george cukor version will agree . the performances in that version by fields as micawber and rathbone as murdstone , are definitely worth the trouble of watching it . and the more recent masterpiece theatre version april 2000 and hallmark 2000 versions are both outstanding achievements in made for television adaptations of classic novels . directors simon curtis and peter medak who are responsible for those films are deserving of the highest praise . my final comment on david copperfield 1969 is don't buy it , there are several much better versions of the film available . if it is on television , turn the channel to something else . it is a waste of one hour and twenty minutes of your life . sorry folks , but i can't praise such an appallingly bad film .",0,1
"the photography is accomplished , the acting is quite good , but in virtually every other department the greek tycoon is a dreary bore . taking its inspiration from the real life love affair of jackie kennedy and aristotle onassis , the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on tv all day long . viewers who embrace the whole celebrity magazine culture paparazzi photographs and gossipy stories about the rich and famous will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here . but those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the 107 minute running time a butt numbing slog . american president james cassidy james franciscus and his beautiful wife liz jacqueline bisset are in greece on official business . a ridiculously wealthy greek shipping tycoon , theo tomasis anthony quinn , catches sight of liz at a party at his elegant manor . despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else , there is an immediate attraction between them . later , at a private party aboard his yacht , tomasis makes his desires known to liz . some while later , president cassidy is assassinated whilst out strolling on a beach . liz is shocked and saddened by his death , but it isn't long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her greek lover tomasis . eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favourite talking point for the world's newspapers , magazines , photographers and wags . it is somewhat amusing to note the vigour with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatisation of the kennedy onassis story . they wanted the film to be seen as an original story , rooted in fiction . but anyone with a brain can see from where the movie is drawing its inspiration . even aristotle onassis himself knew the greek tycoon amounted to his love life getting the hollywood treatment if rumours are to be believed , he actually had a hand in approving anthony quinn for the tomasis role ! j . lee thompson isn't really the right sort of director for this type of movie he's better suited to action fodder like the guns of navarone and ice cold in alex but he marshals the proceedings with an uninspired , professional adequacy . quinn is very watchable as tomasis ; bisset looks lovely as the object of his desires ; franciscus uses his toothy smile and a fa ade of integrity to make for a believable politician . their performances are good on the surface , but there's little for the actors to do on any deeper level . similarly , tony richmond's photography gives the film an elegant surface sheen as it moves from one exotic locale to the next , but the merest of scratches proves that there's nothing behind the film's glossy exterior .",0,1

"watching truth about love is this a double entendre about the star ? is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep you put it in the dvd slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day . and it works for that for that purpose being a british romantic comedy it is a bit more . the story is a rather simple one about a wife alice jennifer love hewitt married to an increasingly distant husband sam jimi mistry who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice . his partner archie dougray scott is fond of both sam and alice , but has a longtime attraction to alice that goes beyond friendship . alice pals with her sister felicity kate miles , a free love advocate , who encourages alice to have affairs . on valentine's day , after a drinking binge with her sister , alice mails a card to sam signed 'anonymous' as a test to see if sam responds , testing his fidelity . at the same time archie mails a radish seed packet to alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not . both have ex post facto regrets . sam in fact is spending time with a lover katya branka katic and is indeed cheating on alice . alice arranges assignations with sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet sam in disguise as 'anonymous' to test his fidelity . the entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise of sorts of the fluffy script . british comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting . perhaps had director john hay elected to cast a british actress as alice instead of pasting a phony accent on jennifer love hewitt the result may have been improved . but in the end this story by peter bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages . one terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive . there are some nice scenes of london and a few moments of passable humor , but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music white noise . grady harp",0,1
"the point of the vastly extended preparatory phase of this star is born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime . summer phoenix is very effective as an inarticulate young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both overcomes and profits from this detachment . even in the lengthy scenes of esther's acting lessons , we never see her carry out the teacher's instructions . after suffering through esther's largely self inflicted pain in excruciating detail , we are given no persuasive sense of her triumph . the obsessive presence of the heroine's pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence . yet the causes of this pain poverty , quasi autism , judaism , sexual betrayal never come together in a coherent whole . a 163 minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit up its loose ends . esther kahn is still not ready to go before an audience .",0,1

"director kinji fukasaku is perhaps best known , in his homeland at least , for his japanese gangster films , a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics . violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both shogun's samurai and battles without honor and humanity , and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals . both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die , and since so little is done to develop them , their deaths have little impact when they do come . this film has other flaws as well . the makeup , costumes and sound design are distractingly poor , and the battle scenes were substandard as well , inferior to other samurai films of earlier years seven samurai comes to mind . sonny chiba plays the sonny chiba character in shogun's samurai , the no nonsense master swordsman who strides through the film , scowling menacingly . what a guy ; he even gets to wear an eye patch . if you were expecting to see the legendary toshiro mifune , you may be disappointed ; his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo , and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting , he disappears for good . overall , the strengths of the film are its story , which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films , and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil . two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father , who may have had some help on his way out . early on , it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn't be more clearly good and evil ; after all , the older brother stammers and has a birthmark , the sure sign of a villain . eventually , however , it becomes clear that in a winner takes all struggle for power , there are no heroes and villains , only winners and losers .",0,1

"what a disappointment ! i've enjoyed the jon cleary books about scobie malone , but there's little resemblance between him and the cinematic malone . in the books he's a city detective , who is devoted to his wife and doesn't get involved in fisticuffs . for the film the character has been spiced up , into an outback copper who uses his fists and isn't averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl , though quite what she and the film's other sex interest see in him i don't know ; taylor was 39 at the time and his face was getting puffy . but his character's stamina is remarkable ; he flies in from australia , apparently goes straight to the commissioner's house rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black tie reception , saves him from assassination getting into a fight in the process , goes to a casino with one girl , leaves with another and takes her to bed . so much for jet lag ! on the way back to the commissioner's house showing a good knowledge of london back streets , he gets beaten up by the baddies , but is still first down to breakfast ! it's also remarkable that the commissioner's limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clock activated bomb . the best thing is joseph the butler's disdain for the uncouth malone . and at least the film avoids being a london travelogue , though some scenes take place during the wimbledon tennis week .",0,1

"spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning . but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty ? nobody should love that . lucius shepard the color purple takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s , and tells the story of celie and nettie , two african american sisters . the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers , an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather . this motif innocence interrupted by men permeates the entire film . the film then launches into a series of short sequences . celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather , gives birth in a dirty barn , has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson , a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly , forcing her to cook , clean and look after his children . all these horrific scenes are given little screen time , and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography , a meddlesome symphonic score , incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work . the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie , a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes . ten minutes ? he lasted a long time . the film is often said to deal which racism , sexism and black culture , but this is not true . alice walker , the author of the novel upon which the film is based , claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian . her book is a lesbian fantasy , a story of female liberation and self discovery , which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women . for walker , the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia , black sisterhood and female independence celebrated . spielberg's film , however , re frames walker's story through the lens of comforting american mythologies . this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men . a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations , moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool . a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows , the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins , stereotypical fat mammies , jazz bands and gospel choirs . this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike , readily and happily accepting their social conditions . a film in which black people are over sexed , carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions . a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept . this is not the old south , this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind , mgm muscals , song of the south , warner cartoons , halleluha ! and banned disney movies . in other words , it's the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv . it's all so cartoonish , so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes , that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy . of course , in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed . this reconciliation was in walker's novel , but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin . beyond walker's hate letter to black men and spielberg's bizarre caricaturing of black life , we are shown nothing of the black community . we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community . instead , spielberg's camera jumps about , desperately fighting for our attention one of celie's kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie , every emotion over played , the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by . couple this with quincy jones' ridiculously white music , and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith , scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams . problematic too is the lack of white characters . consider this the men in this film aren't portrayed as being rough to each other , nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood . no , they are cruel by nature . and the women , whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister , persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them . a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed , rather , it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse , that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors , women unable to support themselves and their children alone . and so there's a hidden ideology at work here . late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wife , she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites . the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them . ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you won't run afoul of the dominant white culture . 3 10 a failure to confront sex and lesbianism , inappropriate musical numbers , countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz , incongruous comic business , emphatic music cues , and wildly hyped emotionality , all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless .",0,1

"jean seberg had not one iota of acting talent . like all her films , 'bonjour tristesse' suffers not at all from her looks though she is perhaps the first of those modern women whom tom wolfe gleefully , accurately describes as boys with breasts publicists , of course , use the word gamine but suffers grievously from seberg's dull , monotonous , killing voice . in all her films when had to play anger , seberg played it with grossly audible , distracting , gasping panting between her monotonously droned verbalizations . oy . preminger's adaptation of fran oise sagan's breathlessly juvenile , fantasy soap opera plot is noteworthy only for his lush cinematography but then that's difficult to funk on the photogenic french riviera , and perhaps for his apt , but certainly not groundbreaking , employment of black white for the present day scenes from which seberg's monotone narration delivers us to the flashed back to color past . juliette gr co has a brief moment , as a nightclub chanteuse in the black white spotlight , delivering in smoky dietrichesque voice the bleak existentialist lyric of the title song . this moment is nowadays , in retrospect , more than a wee bit dr le . except , of course , if you're french particularly if you're a french 68 er longing for the glorious days of the barricades roundabout the sorbonne and your kids riot to retain the lifelong sinecures which have blighted and emasculated france's economy then you still believe in sartre and foucault and all such arcane , irrelevant theorists . david niven has the hardest role , having to play with sufficient gusto an aging hedonist who's yet to grasp that life isn't all about sagan's teenybopper notions of a hip , cool , swingin' , mon copain ! papa . deborah kerr delivers her usual , consummately professional presence , convincingly playing the woman who suffers undeservedly seberg's spiteful teenaged snot nose jealousy fulfilling sagan's shallow teen fantasy of the classical theme of there can be only one queen bee in the hive ; in fact , to kerr belongs this film's sole great and memorable on screen moment . the dialogue is unnatural i agree with an earlier reviewer who said that it sounds to be badly translated from french ; combine the unnatural scripting with seberg's incomparably dull , unendurable monotone and you can save that valium for another night . atop all that the ineptly synched post production voice dubbing is , almost throughout , obvious and thus much more than irksome this is especially true of the dubbing for myl ne demongeot because it spoils her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performance . hunky geoffrey horne gets the short end of the stick here a very good looking young man who also suffered from a less than lovely , uncinematic voice which , when paired with seberg's drone , yields unconvincing scenes of puppy love . horne was , shall we say , merely adequate in 'bridge on the river kwai , ' perhaps because his end was held up by those great cinema pros william holden and jack hawkins instead of being unsupported by the regrettably ungifted seberg . in sum 'bonjour tristesse' is pretty to look at but it's shallow , immature soap thin gruel with suds .",0,1

"i have a question for the writers and producers of prozac nation what is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in america ? in the moving performance of christina ricci as liz wurtzel , the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a harvard student and as a writer . but this is not a story of success , only one of self destruction as we watch liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her . the film examines divorce , family dysfunction , drugs , alcohol , and prescription medication as possible reasons for liz's unhappiness . but none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory . at some point in the film , it would have been helpful to suggest that liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems . no light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in the united states of depression . in the story , liz had a caring therapist anne heche , a caring roommate michele williams , a caring boyfriend jason biggs , and a troubled but caring parent jessica lange . in a key scene in the film , liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break up of the space shuttle challenger . instead of equating challenger with liz's life , the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery . this film reminded me of a generic made for cable victim film on the lifetime network . an excellent cast was wasted , especially in the earnest performance of christina ricci . the real life elizabeth wurtzel obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author . it is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit .",0,1
"your time and brains will be much better spent reading or listening to charlie wilson's war . phillip seymour hoffman , plays the most enjoyable character in the movie , gust , the greek , and he plays him as a eunuch . gust , in the book , is hard core and completely free to speak his mind . in the movie , he's not even shown as being equally important to charlie . and poor charlie is never shown donating blood which he did every time he visited the camps in pakistan . in short , the movie is too bland , and the history is too old for our modern time . we don't really care about the end of the cold war and the defeat of the soviet union which happened in spite of reagan , not as a result of by a well financed group of people who were extremely willing to fight . not quite the lesson we need to be hearing and seeing considering how well the wars in iraq and afghanistan are going . as i read the book , i kept getting that deja vu feeling , except it was present day .",0,1

"i saw this film at its premier at sundance 09 . since american beauty is a movie that had something to say , i had hopes for towelhead . unfortunately , it was a disappointment . in fact , of countless movies i've seen in almost a dozen sundance festivals , towelhead is the only sundance movie i've ever wanted to walk out early from . the worst problem with towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of provocative concepts concerning cultural stereotypes , rather than with an organic human drama . the screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by alicia erian . the famous edith wharton quote comes to mind i have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views . that observation is especially devastating for towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic . if there ever was a time when towelhead's white male villains , condescending portrayals of blacks , ironic treatments of foreign cultures , etc . , were fresh , it's long past . for a more detailed review , please look up any of the many professional reviews available online . almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on . on the other hand , the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled . as you read through the reviews in this and similar sites , you'll frequently come across superlatives stunning , breathtaking , profound , shocking , . it embarrasses me to read them , but it does not surprise me . indeed , i've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial , cultural , gender , or sexual issues as deeply moving , thought provoking , full of profound insight . if you are such a person , by all means , rent towelhead and be moved by it . on the other hand , if you set your standards higher , you can safely pass on this one .",0,1
"anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal , the author of the novel and screenplay , to air her prejudices , grievances and general antipathy towards the english . the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul . the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight , violent , foul mouthed , promiscuous , engaging in child neglect , stupid , uneducated , racist , ugly , eating poor food , and dim witted tellingly , only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be redeemed at the end of the film . by contrast , the indian family are beautiful , clever , educated , can speak many languages , are caring and loving parents , and grammar school fodder . the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all . had it been the other way round , an english family in an indian community depicted this way , the film would have been seen as racist . there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead , i thought it would lodge in my hairline . first , the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration undertext the english are dirty and promiscuous and the men undertext english women are prostitutes . second , the meal with anita where neema's family lie to her about cutlery undertext the english are so stupid , you can make them do anything . but the underlying contempt towards anything english even english weddings are an object of scorn is evident all the way through the film . the character of anita was drawn so appallingly almost the fallen woman trope that i finished the film feeling angry . this is not a bend it like beckham where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community's behaviour and customs from somebody within that community , and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together . instead , anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable , as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste , and this is underscored by a thinly veiled series of attacks upon the film's other community the english . i felt anita and me is a hate filled , grievance based piece of work . on that basis , the bbc should not have funded its production .",0,1

"rating 4 out of 10 as this mini series approached , and we were well aware of it for the last six months as sci fi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads , i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned more . as with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time , different people go to it to see different things . in this regard , when people think of battlestar galactica , they remember different things . for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor . for others , it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time . many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s , especially those on television . for some the memories resolve around the story arc . others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced . frankly , i come from the latter group . the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire . yes , evil . the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it . while base stars were swirling around , men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources , and somehow they managed to survive until the next show . they didn't survive because they had better technology , or more fire power . they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show . the show had its flaws , and at times was sappy , but they were people you could care about . the writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this . in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show , the character's names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction . since that was their goal , they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure . it was far from a reinvention . in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time . it borrows liberally from st tng , st ds9 , babylon 5 , and even battlefield earth . i find that unfortunate . ronald d . moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade , and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see . one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d e . that was the inviolable rule of roddenberry's st tng . like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority , ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene roddenberry . here , instead of writing the best story possible , he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could . besides being dysfunctional , some of it was not the least bit believable . anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack , they could have gotten execution , and they never would have gotten out the next day . it wouldn't have happened , period , especially in time of war . the thing that i remembered most of ron moore's earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt . james kirk . he killed capt . kirk , and , alas for me , he has killed battlestar galactica .",0,1
"the bearings of western style feminism on the various subcultures of india have hitherto remained largely non existent , the two entities belonging to alien realms and threatening in the name of tradition never to coincide . art imitates life or so the claim goes and popular hindi cinema is no exception , reflecting an underlying misogyny which , regrettably , forms the foundation of much of the collective indian culture . but why ? what is it about the female gender that has rendered it so hateful to the culture that women are routinely subject to the most unimaginable horrors , including rape , murder , infanticide , imposed illiteracy , infidelity , and the subjugation of spirit that goes under the name of 'dowry' ? rajkumar santoshi's latest offering , lajja , asks the same plaintive question , linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters episodes which comprise the journey of shame endured by its protagonist , vaidehi manisha koirala . direction on santoshi's part is not up to par with the level the story demands . he fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity in depicting the saga of sadness and confronts the issue of misogyny from the side , instead of head on . santoshi has recently said that he did not make the film for an international film festival , but rather for the masses of his country . regrettably , the tackiness shows , and the film too often delves into the action blood gore genre that santoshi specializes in . the film suffers from its jerky , episodic pace and its ending is rather too contrived . the female cast is given much kinder and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts . the protagonist is played sensitively by the luminescently beautiful manisha koirala who proves in lajja that she is one of our time's more competent leading ladies , and given a proper role and set up , emerges with a truly commendable performance . one wonders how brilliantly she may have shone had the film been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the issue at hand . mahima choudhary puts in a laudable performance and continues to show that she is an untapped talent . cast as janki , madhuri dixit performs with a never before seen fervor and felicity for what truly deserves the name of 'acting . ' the role of a street smart performer who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the greatest risk in her cannon of song n dance roles which have maintained her marquee status over the past decade . which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this would be feminist saga , that of the ceaselessly talented rekha . lajja is manisha koirala's film , there can be no doubt about that , but it is rekha who dominates the proceedings in a performance that digs into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the vestibules of your heart . rekha dazzles as ramdulari , foregoing vanity and complacency to deliver a performance that is so replete with authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this portion of the film . comparisons are indeed odious , especially when rendered opposite one of the world's great leading ladies , but in the gracious presence of this reigning screen legend the others fade in her shadow . lajja has none of the sophistication of proto feminist dramas like zubeidaa , pinjar , or even the hell queen celebration laadla it fulfills its feministic goals in two early moments the loud tirade in which mahima berates her in laws for their abuse of her father who has committed no other crime than given birth to a girl . she erupts , leaving the wedding procession in shambles . seeing her father devastated , she begins to weep , blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her . she bemoans , why did i say anything ? i have ruined everything ! it is all my fault ! her grandmother , witnessing silently the abuse she bore , comforts her by saying , why are you crying ? there is no reason for you to be crying . you are not at fault for anything . the fault is mine . the fault is of every woman who came before you , because if we had had the courage to say in our day what you have said today , there would have been no need for you to say anything today . in this scene the importance of the feminist legacy is laid plainly in sight through words . the other , more subtle moment comes very early in the film when vaidehi manisha has fled from her abusive husband to the refuge of her parents' home in india . to viewers of western societies , it may seem perfectly reasonable indeed , natural that any abused woman would seek the protective guardianship of her parents ; this , however , is a societal taboo in many eastern cultures , india among them . once a woman has been married , the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets family , business , children , etc . for her to turn her back on these responsibilities is a grave social sin , one which truly has no equivalent for the western woman . she is thereafter regarded as tainted and as 'damaged goods' , one whose value has been nullified entirely by her own actions and her refusal to submit to the role she has been given . she is not so much an individual as she is an emblem of familial honor . her father rebukes her for her actions , concerned that his familial honor will be tarnished irreparably by the daughter he had already transferred to another man . his primary concern is that of the impending marriage of vaidehi's younger sister , a prospect made far less likely with a divorced elder daughter in the same household . he tells her in no uncertain that she must return to the man to whom she lawfully belongs , however violent and sadistic he may be . he levies against her the age old adage that , the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter . quietly and pensively , she replies , yes , the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter . but there is no honor for the daughter herself .",0,1
"i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film . one thing i see , over and over , is annoyance with megan , the idealistic political scientist , trying to change the world . i loved her character . maybe , because i am a 23 year old political science student and i think i'm going to change the world too , so i relate to megan . besides , she's cute . she's no super model , but more of a cute girl next door . ok , so she cried and screamed a lot . it's very dramatic , and seems overdone , but doesn't it fit her character ? she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point . she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick . i think she made her argument very well . of course , being a young naive girl , she is terrified of what she is about to face . i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear . furthermore , i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in . as for the movie in general , other than megan , it was pretty much what i expected . it had excellent gore scenes , by micro budget standards . the plot maybe took a quick thought , hardly any contemplation . it's basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film , which the name implies . i love the sadism of the doctor . he kept ripping megan's shirt off , not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so , but also to torment her , before he kills her . the chainsaw hick was hilarious . for slasher film lovers , he was probably the best character . i give this film 4 out of 10 . it had a good setting , almost no plot , and a mix of good and terrible acting . i would recommend it for a cheap thrill , but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro budget horror .",0,1

' falls into the latter category and isn't even as good as 'the big lebowski' or 'the hudsucker proxy . ' 'o brother' is basically an episodic series of in jokes without much point , and not all that much humor or cleverness either . as most reviewers have noted , the film's plot is very loosely and , as far as i could tell , quite arbitrarily based on the odyssey . its main character , ulysses everett mcgill george clooney , is an 'adventurer' like his homeric namesake and has as his 'real' goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor . of course , we don't discover that this is what the clooney ulysses character really wants until long after we've stopped caring . and what does homer have to do with cool hand luke chain gangs , ku klux klan meetings a la indiana jones cult gatherings , a disbarred lawyer's vocabulary , a talent for blue grass country music singing , an association with baby face nelson , a clark gable lookalike hairdo , and other random and sundry character traits and encounters ? i leave that for others to discern . the allusion to preston sturges' 'sullivan's travels' in 'o brother's' title is equally pointless . yes , viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make . and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot scene riffs e . g . hopping freight cars , and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie . but so what ? the coen brothers don't seem to have anything to add to the art for art's sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art . they obviously fall into the former school , but that doesn't seem to motivate the reference in the slightest . is it an homage ? if so , why make it ? i like post modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person , but it's a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally , if not thematically , consistent and not just an arbitrary concoction . this screenplay is simply a silly mess . the only consistent , and consistently pleasing , element is the folk country music soundtrack . it doesn't have much to do with homer or preston sturges , but , considering the rest of the film , that's probably a good thing . on the other hand , i'd recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd .",0,1

"terrible below par not bad good brilliant warning minor spoilers homosexuality these day's is hardly the taboo subject it was over forty years ago . however it must be said that perhaps more so in america than say , over here in the u . k . it can still be a touchy subject . just look at the whole debacle of gay's in the millitary some years ago in the us . it's with 'in and out' that writer paul rudnick taps in to the small town mentality of middle america and the way the press in the us as well as in the uk make such a big deal in outing a celebrity . you need only look at when will young and stephen gately of boyzone came out of the closet . the movie centres on howard brackett kevin kline , a high school english teacher in his home town . the local people are preparing themselves for oscar night as one of the nominees cameron drake matt dillon came from their town and was a former pupil of howards . cameron , who plays a gay soldier in a vietnam epic wins the award only to out howard as being gay during his acceptance speech . this could not come at a worse time for howard who is just day's away from marrying his fiance and fellow school teacher emily joan cusack . as you would expect the media reaction is cataclysmic and turn's howards life upside down . not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay but evade sleazy news reporter , peter malloy tom selleck . although this was billed as a screwball comedy it's clear that rudnick and director frank oz are also attempting to be satirical . you only have to look at the early scenes at the oscars cerimonee and the way the people of bracketts home town as well as the teaching board of the school react to his outing . sadly the film doesn't live up to the promise we see early on in the movie . this is a pretty flat attempt to make social commentary out of a wacky comedy . a good cast is sadly wasted on a script that never really delivers the nessecary amount of laughs and is no where near as insightful as it thinks it . kline gives us the same kind of endearing performance that he gave us in his earlier comedy 'dave' , making howard an instantly likeable character . cusack too is good value as howard's weight obsessed fiance while tom selleck play's very well against type as a gay news reporter . bob newhart is a joy also , as the principal of the high school where howard works . it's great to see him on the big screen for a change . it's a shame that it had to be this . the performances as good as they are can do little to rescue the movie from being a rather dull affair . while a couple of scenes do offer some amusement . namely the inspired scene where howard attempts to make himself seem more manly by listening to a self help tape . there is little to enjoy , and when things can't seem to get any worse rudnick resorts to a sickening finale that lurches in to over the top sentiment . i also couldn't help but feel that my intelligence was being insulted . malloy appears to be too sleazy a character to become the man who put's his ethics before getting a good story while cammeron finally come to the rescue in the film's climax seems at first to be too self involved a character to care a jot about what happens to his former teacher . after all it's he who caused all the trouble in the first place . 'in and out' isn't exactly dire . but when you consider the likes of klines better work like 'a fish called wanda' you can't help but feel that here is a great talent being sadly wasted . robs rating",0,1

"fox's the true story of jesse james 1957 is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 tyrone power henry fonda classic jesse james . i'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters , the uneven direction of nicholas ray and the ham fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it . in the late thirties and forties tyrone power was fox's top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head darryl zanuck started to groom newcomer robert wagner to take his place . this was a major error on zanuck's part as wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement . with the possible exceptions of broken lance 1954 and between heaven hell 1956 it is hard to think of wagner distinguishing himself in anything ! also , jeffrey hunter was nothing more than a fox contract player before being assigned to play frank james to wagner's jesse in the true story of jesse james . borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor's one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in john ford's classic the searchers . but his playing here , along with wagner as the second half of the james brothers , is nothing short of boring . neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles . they totally miss the mark , lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by power and fonda in the original . the movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay wagner , as the robin hood of the american west , comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever . the supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as agnes moorhead barely getting a look in as ma james . the best aspects of this uninvolving so so western is the wonderful cinemascope colour cinematography by the great joe mcdonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer leigh harline !",0,1
"so . it's really sexist , and classist , and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie , like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change . well , he certainly changed his tune , and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit . what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers . the end of the movie does not make her a hero , it makes the whole thing sad . and its sad that people think it makes her a hero . perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away . positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience . yuck .",0,1

"ok , here it is nazi mountaineer befriends the dalai lama . what we do is , first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a germanic accent , and we let him flounder around between french , german , american , and british for over 2 hours . then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely , so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly . but just to make sure the viewer doesn t fall asleep , we throw in details which are shockingly absurd , such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22 , 000 feet . naturally , we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles , so we have every character , even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed off city of lhasa in 1943 , speak perfect english , also with dubious accents . of course , the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story , so what we do is this we have the dalai lama befriend the now reformed nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors , radios , antique cars , and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west . in return , our hero learns from his young proteg a kind of vague , undefined buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion . we also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the tibetan society accords the dalai lama , even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader . in other words , we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a buddhist , sort of , in his own way , even though we ourselves don t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go . and last but not least , we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the chinese have treated the tibetans which is certainly true , thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a political movie , even though it is nothing of the sort . so , zat ist my idea . vat do you zink ? can ve make zis movie ?",0,1
"gold raiders 1951 a dull western comedy feature with the three stooges including shemp howard at this point , who i've always enjoyed as the third stooge doing their usual schtick , and directed by the normally dependable edward bernds , who also did some of their funniest classic shorts so one has to wonder , just what went wrong this time ? the most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15 minute two reeler comes up as too much for a 55 minute feature film . unlike so many of their classic short subjects , gold raiders is not worth revisiting . 1 2 of",0,1

"four eyed monsters follows the relationship of a shy , reclusive videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist , who , both living in the big apple , develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site . this in itself is not so unusual , but what is , is their method of communication . foregoing the verbal , they take to writing notes and later communicating through video . the film is based upon the creator's arin crumley susan buice own relationship , who besides writing and directing , take to acting as the lead characters as well . with elements of avant garde , anti plot , and docudrama , the film scatters itself to the wind with an undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and self indulgence . as the movie wears on , a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the hardship of reality . focusing solely on inner conflict , or the woes of relationship , the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original , nor poignant . this could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict , and a third act , to which there is none just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere . what is even more aggravating is the film's descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish . this would have been all fine and dandy , but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or pondered . on a side note , the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack , one of the more interesting aspects of the production . but as always , watch the film and decide for yourself .",0,1
"what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way ? this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches unctuous priests , spitting before handshakes , town square cattle marts , cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music . quickly , however , it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy o of irish cliches religous strife . it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic fathered child is educated , which would seem like a reasonable enough wish , though not to the '50's county wexford villagers she has to live with . rather than send them to a catholic school , she decides to up and leave for belfast , then scotland , where a few more cliches are reguritated . while she's there , her father who looks eerily like george lucas and family back home are subjected to a boycott , which turns very nasty . i'm not going to give away the ending , not because i think people should go see this movie , but because it's not very interesting . one of the problems with the film is the central character we're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life . the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to , but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it . in addition , it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process the woman is told by her lawyer that she must lay down preconditions for her return . the film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively , and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches , in the past .",0,1

"somewhere , on this site , someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of jane austen , one should simply read them . i agree with that . however , we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers' strike brings to mind that without good writers , it's hard for actors to bring their roles to life . the current version of jane austen's persuasion shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well written adaptation . this version does not compare to the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds , which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters with the exception of the bizarre parade kissing in the street scene in bath . the 2007 version shows a twitty anne who seems angst ridden . the other characters were not very developed which is a crime , considering how austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements . the sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about , and mrs . smith , anne's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in bath twittering away , as many of the characters seemed to do . the strength of character and the intelligence of captain wentworth , which caused anne to love him in the first place , didn't seem to be written into the rupert penry jones' wentworth . ciaran hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look , than p j was able to do with his poses . all in all , the 2007 version was a disappointment . it seemed to reduce the novel into a hand wringing , costumed melodrama of debatable worth . if they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into austen's work , they should have done what they do with adaptations of shakespeare adapt it to the present . at least bride prejudice was taken out of the historical locational settings and was fun to watch , as was clueless . this wasn't persuasion , but they didn't know what else to call it .",0,1
"alain resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world . in one of them is a sort of operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness only his attempt misses it's only real target , the woman that he pines after . in the same unfinished ch teau he built , a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story , as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropoligist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group . meanwhile , a bunch of kids fantasize a george melies like adventure of a prince that saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures and then kills the evil king , bringing upon the kingdom of love . the two primary themes ? life is a fairy tale , and life isn't a fairy tale . which sounds better than the movie actually is . resnais is the type of director where oftentimes the concept is good or bad , but the exposition is what matters ; here , the concept is great but the movie is downright painful to watch . horridly off tune songs , bubbly characters without an ounce of dimension , backdrops of sickening pastel instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone , resnais drowns it in a bucket of cake frosting . add some french philosophy and you get a weird witches brew , one that doesn't bubble bubble toil and trouble , but just kinda sits wrong in your stomach until you want to regurgitate it . resnais is a risk taking director , and even in his worst you can see he's trying something that might not work with full clarity of action . in i want to go home , he manages to pull past annoying characters and ditzy set pieces by showing some real change and having a moment few moments of quiet to catch his breath . here he submerges directly into a fantasy that doesn't really reflect fantasy , only its baby's room wallpaper reference . the biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an 80s pop video , and more kitsch than golden era hollywood musicals . the fantasies are beyond childish and naive , but the movie with nudity and profanity is definitely aimed for adults , a target he decidedly missed . however , he sticks closely to his theme and never backpedals . if anything , this movie is impressive simply because its unapologetic . polarisdib",0,1

"when na ve young eddie hatch , a window dresser at savory's department store , falls for a statue of venus and gives her a chaste kiss , venus steps off her pedestal and gives eddie more than he bargained for . this creaking example of what hollywood can do to a broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first rate songs . the purpose was to make a safe , popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on ava gardner's upward mobility to super stardom . robert walker as eddie gets lost in a thankless role . eddie's not just naive , but dithering and hapless . gardner is gorgeous , but the only things that give the movie any life are olga san juan as eddie's loving but jealous girl friend , tom conway as the suave owner of savory's and eve arden as savory's long time , wise cracking secretary . it's a role arden could play in her sleep , and she's good at it . the musical opened on broadway in 1943 and made mary martin a big time star . the only point of a musical , however , is to have music . since one touch of venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts , kurt weill , composing , and ogden nash writing the lyrics , came up with a series of stylish , witty songs and one masterpiece . without the satire , or the clever songs or martin or an equivalent showstopper , the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death . not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the weill nash songs , they brought in the movie's music director , ann ronell , to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived , turning sharp observation into lovey dovey romance . ronell was no hack ; she wrote willow weep for me . wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked ogden nash's clever work . the one bright spot in the movie is that weill nash masterpiece . speak low is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote . it's given one of those ultra professional and lifeless treatments by eileen wilson dubbing gardner . dick haymes contributes a chorus . as for ann ronell , she was one of the few women in hollywood to become a major music director , as well as composer and lyric writer . yours for a song the women of tin pan alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business , including ronell , kay swift , dorothy fields and dana suess . and for those who would like to hear what little of the weill nash score was recorded by the original broadway cast , you might be able to track down the cd , one touch of venus 1943 original cast lute song 1946 original cast . the music is paired with lute song , another broadway show that starred martin .",0,1
"seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners . although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring . i think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show , who can come up with something really new . it's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more 'hip' and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting beyonce perform and letting p . diddy and prince present a category . also letting chris rock be the presenter was an attempt to re new the ceremony and make it more appealing . none of it really worked out . sure , chris rock is a funny guy but he wasn't really a good presenter . i really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories . his presence wasn't really as 'big' as for instance billy crystal's . also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times . not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird . still , i can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners . none of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case . so does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants ? i don't think so . i think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now , with the exception of million dollar baby and the passion of the christ maybe . sure i don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year , for instance caleb deschanel should had won for best cinematography , not that i don't like robert richardson's work , he really did some amazing work for most of oliver stone's work but i really feel that deschanel deserved the award way more . also i would had liked seeing jim miller and paul rubell win for best editing and john debney for best music . but oh well , there is no way the academy awards can please everybody of course , i understand that . there will always be people complaining about the winners . it also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners . did prince said any of the nominees names right at once ? and were is sean penn's sense of humor ? al pacino and jeremy i hope they missed irons were the best presenters of the night . overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners . 4 10",0,1

"this film aka the four hundred blows is a mistranslation . faire les 400 coups means to live a wild life . as a french , i'm stunned when i see the popularity of this good , but by no means outstanding film . 1 . it's not the first film of the nouvelle vague move ; check agnes varda's la pointe courte , 1956 alain resnais's hiroshima mon amour 1958 , claude chabrol's le beau serge 1958 are anterior . historically , les 400 coups comes after . 2 . the nouvelle vague was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors overnight , julien duvivier , henri george clouzot , claude autant lara , yves all gret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion . this selfishness and this contempt is typically nouvelle vague . you 've never heard or read the great generation of the thirties renoir , carn , gr millon , duvivier already , feyder laugh at , say , maurice tourneur or max linder . so , thanks to truffaut and co , some people will never discover some gems of the french fifties or forties duvuvier's sous le ciel de paris , autant lara's douce , yves all gret's une si jolie petite plage and man ges . the novelle vague clique went as far as saying that william wyler , georges stevens and fred zinemann were worthless ! 3 . les 400 coups is technically rather disappointing it's very academic , the story is as linear as it can be , the teachers are caricatures , and the mother claire maurier delivers such memorable lines as you've got to be a french circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is well , your father 's got only his brevet junior school diploma and , as for me , i've got only my high school diploma ! you've got to know , that circa 1960 , hardly 10 of the pupils had the hsd in france ! antoine doinel should have been proud of his mother after all ! she wants him to have diplomas , who can blame her ? 4 . compared to the innovations of hiroshima mon amour , which features a brand new form , and a new fragmented content , les 400 coups pales into significance . truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior jules and jim , helped by the incomparable jeanne moreau . 5 . the interpretation is rather stiff ; jean pierre l aud , arguably listenable when dubbed in english , is still decent , but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation . 6 . the topic stolen childhood had better days , before julien duvivier's poil de carotte , luis bunuel's los olvidados and will have after maurice pialat's l'enfance nue , kenneth loach's kes i do not want to demean truffaut , his movie is not bad , but , frankly , french movie buffs , prefer jules and jim l'enfant sauvage a film honest , true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault l'argent de poche as academic as 400 coups but much more funny or his nice hitchcock pastiche vivement dimanche .",0,1
"crystal voyager is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in australia . an american by birth george greenough has surfed and photographed himself , friends and recently , dolphins , in australia for 35 years , all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back , board or boat . in the mid 70s he teamed up with surf mag editor and budding film maker david elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography . the 75 minute feature crystal voyager is the result . even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film , neither surf ing movie nor surf movie , because george swims about on a children's zippy board , not a real surfboard . it offset the tedious droning of george occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny . like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something with a spectacular 'you are there' power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to pink floyd music . in 1974 when the sydney opera house opened , it also contained a cinema . crystal voyager was booked in there as an arty sporty oz pic and by default became a hit as the 'opera house tickets' cost far more than a movie ticket , audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to 'have been to the sydney opera house' . so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show 'there' . this created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread . as a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon fantastic planet and had a trippy run through the uk and europe as a double feature . i ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all . recently george has re emerged lord of the flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called dolphin glide that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of byron bay . it is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min 'how george did it' short . each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in january 2005 . all of which makes crystal voyager a 'you had to have been there' fluke all those years ago . however at a special oz surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up . but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films . so the damned thing fluked another box office binge . how many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate . again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation . elfick however , since 1975 , has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded australian and international films . look up no worries or starstruck or undercover or rabbit proof fence or love in limbo for clear and present applause at his achievements . george , however , is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film , or drop a camera on .",0,1
"'this life' is truly as bad as it gets . its cast of mercenary , lascivious , ruthless , duplicitous , shallow characters are intended as a reflection on its post eighties setting and i have to admit in this regard it is an accurate creation . unfortunately , it leaves me nothing to sympathise with or care about and i regard it as just another step toward the television premium rate phone in scams ; astonishingly bad , cheap , reality and 'celebrity' saturated television ; and other cut and run attitudes that have destroyed this medium and , indeed , much of british society . sounds exaggerated ? i don't think it is . in this regard programs such as 'this life' have indeed been as influential as they are often called .",0,1

"the real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair . presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape . one can imagine that by the time miranda richardson got contacted by her agent , the conversation went along the lines of 'do you want to shoot a movie in dublin scripted by neil jordan ? michael caine and michael gambon are already in ! ' this is a dull 'comedy' that sees michael caine and dylan moran try and pull off a well planned hustle where moran must imitate a london gangland boss whose arrival is imminent to collect a sizeable sum of cash from local kingpin michael gambon . the rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly . moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as black books . caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched . one can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie it can't even have been a summer in dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background . gambon actually steals the show , and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of have i got news for you will know that he is a wonderfully funny man . but overall the result is disappointing , and it seems a lifetime ago that neil jordan was making quality movies of the likes of mona lisa .",0,1
"this was another obscure christmas related title , a low budget mexican production from exploitation film maker cardona night of the bloody apes 1969 , tintorera ! 1977 , which like many a genre effort from this country was acquired for release in the u . s . by k . gordon murray . judging by those two efforts already mentioned , cardona was no visionary and , this one having already received its share of flak over here , is certainly no better ! the film , in fact , is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized mexican horror outings from the era , but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color which , in view of the prominence of reds apart from st . nick himself , the devil plays a major role in the proceedings throughout , was essential . anyway , in a nutshell , the plot involves satan's efforts to stall santa claus' christmas eve rendezvous with the earth's children ; there is , however , plenty more wackiness along the way to begin with , our portly , white bearded and chronically merry man in red lives in a celestial palace who , apart from accompanying toy maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing laboriously for the whole first reel ! in their native tongue , visits merlin the famed magician at king arthur's court , here bafflingly but amusingly prone to child like hopping and mumbling gibberish ! once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible by the way , the wizard's anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of dr . frankenstein in son of dracula 1974 ! ; incidentally , by this time , he always seems to have gained some excess weight so santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney ! the devil's antics enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up to hold up st . nick's delivery program , then , is perfectly puerile indeed , their tit for tat shenanigans resemble an old laurel hardy routine more than anything ! to pad out the running time , we focus on three sets of children one , the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for christmas than their company projected as a wish fulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra large packages ! , a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own the horned one first tempts her to steal one , then invades the little one's dreams to no avail and a trio of brats who , egged on once again by satan , think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves . there is definitely imagination at work here , but it is applied with little rhyme or reason , while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure well at bay !",0,1
"the movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the stooges . the story is told from the point of view of moe howard and his relationships with his brothers shemp and jerome curly howard , also the life long friendship with larry fine . the movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the stooges multi decade career . the casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble . the actor who plays curly howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved stooge . a must see for any fan of three stooges shorts .",0,1
"this film reminds me a lot of the anti drug films of the 50's and 60's due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about . tom hanks and his buddies are role playing , but there are no dice , lots of candles , and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing hanks falling for the lady in the group . quite funny but misguided . i wonder how many poor kids had their d d stuff destroyed , and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction . as a film it's basically an after school special , bad acting although hanks does show some of his talent and relationship talks , and no one seems to be having any fun . it seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism , which is more serious , apparently , and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does . despite my vote of 2 , this is worth watching due to its unique genre , scare films , which i personally find quite funny .",0,1

"this movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone , such as the robe , quo vadis , and samson and delilah , unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isn't a jew or christian as morally depraved and decadent . the focus is only on biblical related stories that ignore the world outside the bible . as far as they are concerned , nothing good came from pagan egypt , greece or rome . any movie that preaches about the one true god gives a short shift to freedom of religion . the movies ignore the fact that ancient judea's lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism . most 1950s religious movies also overlook the loss of freedom the occurred after christians assumed political power in the 4th century .",0,1
"congratulations to christina ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great film . ricci is my favorite actress she is so gifted , so natural , her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly radiates , which gives credence to the often misapplied term star . the film misses its mark for lots of various reasons , but perhaps most notably for the story's seeming unadaptability to the screen in making it a compelling narrative . more on that later . the cast at first glance is excellent , but come to think of it , jessica lang as the jewish mother is too protestant and not exactly right , ann hetch doesn't come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book , and when your making a movie , how can you justify saying no to anne heche and jessica lange ? but the real problems are in the film's construction first in the failure to elicit any kind of lasting sympathy for the elizabeth wurtzle character , and second to say anything meaningful regarding the all too common and horrible situation that this poor girl finds herself in . unfortunately do to the flashback construction , lizzy merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most , but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she comes off in the book . this is a major problem . this story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist's couch . she is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors , both society and the home , and this is a crucial point in not only eliciting the proper sympathy for her but also of the gravitas of her case . she is so talented , and such a vulnerable and disaffected spirit so early on , that one's heart can't help but reach out to her due to her victimization . this is missed on the film . ultimately one has to come to terms with what the film is trying to say it is a biopic of one severely affected girl , but also it is a film about a nation who can't get its act together ; that is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the film where the chosen at harvard are even more messed up than the average college enrollee . the film finally isn't able to get either of these messages across compellingly , and that's too bad . is prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing , or a mixed blessing or a seeming necessity in a country in which so many people can't function without a chemical crutch ? these are tough and challenging concepts to work with and the writing does not really attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way . the challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional america , but that doesn't have the effect it's suppose to have due to the crosscutting and insufficient earlier development of controlling themes . ricci's performance is tight and heartfelt , and one of the best of her acting career . michele williams is also superb in her role .",0,1
"there are those who gripe that this is not the opera , but then they don't quibble with the film of cabaret that was not the original show either . all films of musicals operas are and have to be adaptations or they don't work . cabaret took more liberties with the original show than did the film of porgy and bess and yet it kept its original integrity , reworking the material , and is judged an artistic success . the same holds true for porgy and bess it reworked the opera into a dialogue song libretto because audiences at the time loved musicals but stayed away from the few echt filmed operas . it would have been economical suicide for preminger to produce a film of the opera it would have lost a fortune for the goldwyn studios . that said , this is a fine adaptation . the acting is excellent , the oscar winning scoring of andre previn is magnificent , as is the choral singing , and the individual vocal achievements are incredible . robert mcferrin dad of popular musician bobby mcferrin dubbed porgy and adele addison dubbed bess . while sammy davis jr . sang his own songs in the film , his recording contract would not permit his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album , so cab calloway recorded his numbers spectacularly for that release . brock peters' bass baritone is extraordinary and pearl bailey is her own unique self . diahann carroll , although a singer of fine note , has the small role of clara which required a high soprano , so old reliable marni nixon dubbed her singing . the gershwin estate hates the film and refuses to grant the musical rights , although the dramatic rights are in the public domain . this sort of hate feud held up the video release of carousel for almost fifteen years although in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in litigation and is currently preventing both porgy and bess and annie get your gun from being released on video . of all the stage productions given film versions , it is these latter two which are the sole holdouts to video . only a campaign of letters to the gershwin estate in ny might loosen up the reserve .",0,1

"tart is the worst movie i've seen this year , and that includes both the affleck j . lo bomb gigli and the rob zombie borefest house of 1000 corpses . i don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that tart was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low budget 1000 corpses . regardless , all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings horrible script , horrible acting , horrible direction . spoilers although i honestly don't think there's anything to spoil tart is about a group of super spoiled private school kids . most of them reside in super sized apartments along new york's hyper expensive park avenue , thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents . the film showcases the aimless life of one of the students cat as she discards her only true friend as frivolous a person as she was in the pursuit of the good life with the in crowd . that , of course , leads to sex , drugs , and music that is substantially worse than rock roll . everything is overly dramaticized in the way that truly bad movies usually are . cat's first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends ; her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose . no heavy handed messages there , he said sarcastically . that's mainly what the seen it before 100 times plot entails . other minor , and even less interesting , plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others , a wild child who lives life on the edge and finally falls off of it one night in the east hamptons , an anti semitic british chick who ends her close friendship with cat the moment she finds out cat has a jewish father , and cat's strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get cat to appreciate the privileged life she has . the thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife . the wild child is played as a toned down version of one of the hilton sisters . the british girl disappears from the film after the break up . the mother daughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the film's final schmaltzy scene , where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts . yawn end spoilers about the cast and crew . dominique swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997's highly watchable lolita and face off . her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few ones to watch lists at the time . she was 17 at the time and i hope that they will not be the best roles of her career . if she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in tart , it very well may be . i've only seen bijou phillips in one other film bully and i swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here . i'm not sure if she's incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar . my guess is that the former is true . i sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned . here , she is the actress tapped to portray the watered down hilton sister . that she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with , and remains friends with , the real life hilton sisters . she's essentially playing a version of herself in this film , and doing a damn poor job of it . as for writer director christina wayne . i know nothing of her other than tart was her first , and only , film project to date . with a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was short lived .",0,1

"as a canadian history major , my first thing to say historical facts are not accurate ! how can a producer do that ? the deportation of the acadian wasn't in 1759 when we see franklin in london , but in 1755 ! how can he pass that in the movie ? the scenes in londo were useless too . then for the story for anyone that read les anciens canadians , you have the story line right there . it's the story of la coriveau , that witch . add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending . sure , it brought tears to my eyes . but that's it . then there's the fact it's apparently set up in qu bec city , but it's mostly shot at the forteresse de louisbourg . sure it's a historical site and it's accurate to the time , but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in qu bec city . overall , if you're looking for a documentary of new france , go get candad a people's history , a real documentary on the history of canda and new france . if you want a love story that will bring you tears , a story set up in a wonderful forest , watch new france .",0,1
"it figures this is a french film , lol , with the emphasis on young girls with much older men . why is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing ? when the age difference is this great , it really comes off as pervy ! valentina cervi is beautiful she bears a strong resemblance to olivia hussey , of zeffirelli's '68 romeo and juliet , set in a similar period , but she looks about 15 and the actor playing tassi , her painting instructor , looks . well , 50 is kind . other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record unusually detailed in this case of the real artemisia , a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period 17th century . her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age old accusation that all great artists were men she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant . not only was she clearly assaulted , and forced into a degrading sexual relationship because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame , but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child . the movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story very dramatic and not in need of any spicing up because in some weird frencified way , it's hotter to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather . that's sexy the truth is boring and seems too feminist politically correct . it also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film . the fact that she painted for decades her famous painting of judith beheading holfernes was painted after , not before the rape , that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy , that she went on to have children . oh that's boring stuff . after all , that's about a middle aged woman and they aren't hot like teenagers . i understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film or a book about a real historical character . you need to create dialog , have subplots , create dramatic structure . certainly some details can be sacrificed it's no big deal if the dates are moved a few years , or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette . and a big boned one , not a skinny minny , or something like that . but to turn her story around on her , and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing . it's even worse because the director is female . she should be horribly ashamed of herself ! if you like this and i know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex , you will probably like dangerous beauty with rufus sewell and catherine mccormack . similarly based on heavily re written history , with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets bon appetit !",0,1
"there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning . first of all we all know what this year's oscar's were really all about this year . it was the academy's way of showing people that they are no racist , and never have been . they wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves . secondly , it's kinda pointless to make remarks about the show , because really , what difference will it make ? but , it's fun to write about it . this is the year i became fed up with the oscar's ! i will never watch the show again . every year they do something wrong . before crowe wins for gladaitor when they real winner should of been ralph fiennes for sunshine . if you haven't seen this movie yet , watch it and you'll agree . eyes wide shut when released receieved no nominations . and as far as this year goes , well , the bad choices were all over the place ! baz lurhmann gets no best director nomination ! are you joking ! a beautiful mind is up for best make up ? training day gets nominated ? the movie was awful , and it seemed like washington didn't even turn in a performance , all he proved was , he knows how to use four letter words ! that's what h won the award for ! take away the language and i bet he was almost playing himself ! i liked gosford park , i really did , but why 7 nominations ? and how on earth could they not give it too altman ! i mean , c'mon , if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings , what about altman ? the man has been in the public's eye for 32 years now and no oscar ! there were many , many things that bothered me about this year's oscar's , but , i'll live with it , as long as i never have to watch another show again ! the highpoint and the only one of the show was when woody allen made his first appearance ever to the award show . that will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show .",0,1
"i don't know about you , but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the often violent interaction between the two characters . mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york , and as far as i am concerned , this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat ! as magical as jerry's exploration of the 'big apple' might be for the other t j fans who have commented here on imdb , i couldn't wait for this self indulgent rubbish to end , so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvd . in fact , the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost 'buys the farm' , hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle , hundreds of feet above a busy road .",0,1
"i was very excited about seeing this film , anticipating a visual excursus on the relation of artistic beauty and nature , containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of rivers and tides . however , that's not what i received . instead , i get a fairly uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature . which is clearly a quite unorthodox claim . the photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed ethical duty he has to the workers occasionally peopling the images , along the periphery . and frankly , the images were not generally that impressive . and according to this artist , scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful . in all respects , a stupid film . for people who'd like to feel better about their environmental consciousness . but not for any one who would like to think about the complexities of the issues surrounding it .",0,1
"cassavetes was clearly an intelligent , sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films . he wanted to be an auteur , to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the american cinema . for that , i applaud him . unfortunately , as a member of his audience , i cannot applaud a woman under the influence . cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic an insane woman and somehow managed to craft a dull film , filled with lengthy , ad libbed ranting and drawn out scenes . he seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moments of a person's life on film , and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run . this tactic would be acceptable if cassavetes had captured something devastatingly real or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not . yet i found the performances , particularly rowlands' , to be artificial . i never believed for a moment that she was really insane . i have met people who are truly mentally disturbed , yet i've never seen any of them act quite like gena rowlands in a woman under the influence . she played it like a very obnoxious , uninhibited woman who drinks a lot , and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once at the beginning , but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film . there are some moments in which she taps into something real , but those moments are few and far between ; she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character . again , i applaud her efforts , but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true . novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high imdb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly , just to prove that they 'get it . ' but don't be brainwashed by the hype judge for yourself . you don't have to pretend to like it . like woody allen , john cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film making , seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he couldn't imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self indulgent . but woody allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie . if cassavetes had employed some self discipline and a sharp pair of editing shears ! , a woman under the influence could have stood a chance . but what's the point of making a 'realistic' film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art house devotees and film students who worship cassavetes as some sort of anti establishment deity ? without dumbing anything down , i believe cassavetes could have made a woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot , instead of presenting a string of 30 minute long scenes of ad libbed arguments . if you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans , you're just reaching the already converted . watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it . if you are truly moved and fascinated by it , good for you .",0,1
"caligula shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 fellini satyricon with bizarre sights , freakishness , and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the glory of ancient rome . but fellini it ain't . first of all it is not as entertaining . far too much screen time is devoted to bug eyed , rubber faced mcdowell in the titular role . his performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing . the portrayals by jay robinson in the robe 1953 and david cain haughton in emperor caligula 1983 are far more persuasive and believable , with the latter being the most nuanced . relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully . as it is , they are little more than cyphers . one example is the role of macro , played by guido mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role , but is mostly left in the background . the only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some prokofiev and stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot . these two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium , however .",0,1

"jochen hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease . were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film , this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non prejudicial infective organism . stefan tom wlaschiha journeys from berlin to san francisco to investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused . he meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory , but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation . simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place , each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from puccini's opera 'turandot' which just happens to be opening at the san francisco opera . a police investigator louise tolliver irit levi and her companion cop kalene parker follow the murders while stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in san francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory . he encounters a strange lad jeffrey jim thalman with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor burroughs richard conti who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects . how this all come to an end is the play of the film , a story as much about the search for self identity between stefan and jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders . while tom wlaschiha , jim thalman and richard conti do well with their roles they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film ! , the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented irit levy and kaylene parker when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero . there are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit , but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of 'nessun dorma' as sung by mario del monaco from a recording o the opera and that seems to be the reason for making the film ! good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors , but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing . grady harp , february 06",0,1
"for a country that has produced some of the world's finest dramatists and has such a rich musical heritage it has always been a source of bewilderment to me why so much of ireland's home grown cinema has been so appalling . perhaps because , by its very nature , those talented in the field of irish cinema have been quick to abandon their native shore for careers in britain or america , colin farrell is a recent case in point , and that the really successful irish directors that have continued to work in ireland and with irish subjects have made their films with international money and an eye on the international market . i am thinking particularly of jim sheridan and neil jordan who alternate between films with an irish setting and projects filmed abroad . middletown , however , is very much an irish film even if two of its principal actors are english . it's certainly well made of its kind and might have bucked the trend that irish films aren't really very good ; paddy breathnach's i went down , written by the brilliant young playwright conor mcpherson , is a crucial exception . unfortunately this tale of fundamentalism set in a fictitious irish town , presumably in the north of ireland judging by the accents , mid ulster bible belt , if you ask me , and presumably in the recent past , the fifties ? the sixties ? , is so over the top that it really is quite ridiculous . nothing in the film rings true and you can't help feeling it's writer , daragh carville , has been strongly influenced by flannery o'connor and that the whole thing might have made more sense had it been set in the american bible belt and not in ireland where even the most extreme protestant fundamentalist was never quite as loony as this . it's all meant be to be grim in a grand guignol kind of way and it certainly is , though i was more prone to giggles than frisson's at the right reverand matthew macfayden's antics . he has the ulster accent off pat and there is nothing wrong with his acting or indeed that of daniel mays as his brother , gerard mcsorley as his father or eva birthistle as mays' wife but the script is so appallingly derivative that good acting can do nothing to save the film . so rather than a step up the ladder for irish cinema middletown is , i'm afraid , just another nail in its coffin .",0,1

"it's common practice for a film about repression to be somewhat muted in style and tone . there's a difference , however , between using restraint and encouraging narcolepsy among audience members . in the secret lives of dentists , starring campbell scott and hope davis , director alan rudolph plays as close to the vest as possible , with the result being a film that never amounts to much beyond a rumination on how teeth are a metaphor for married life . scott gives a fine performance in the role of david hurst , a dentist married to another dentist davis . rudolph sets up the dynamic of their relationship quickly he is completely absorbed in the day to day duties of being the parenthood , she is quietly disillusioned with their frantic family life and then ratchets up the tension when scott may or may not witness his wife with another man . from this point on , the film focuses on whether or not david is going to confront his wife dana about her possible adultery , or whether she will beat him to the punch and leave for good . from time to time , david is treated to visits from an imaginary friend in the form of a former patient played by denis leary borrowing heavily from brad pitt's tyler durden in fight club . while there is enough uncertainty about dana's infidelity and david's instability to warrant examination , the last two thirds of the film are embarrassingly empty of theme or narrative . instead , rudolph creates drama out of a nasty fever that travels slowly through the hurst family , culminating in a pointless hospital visit at the film's climax . the film never picks up on the hints at what david is really capable of if he wasn't so dedicated to his family ; neither does it spend much time looking at dana's precarious balancing act between her family life and her other , more fulfilling ambitions . by choosing to spend the majority of the film worrying over a fever gone awry , rudolph kills the momentum of his film . by the time the fifth member of the family shows up sweating and sickly , the film has used up all the good graces of scott's well measured performance . david and dana end up retracing their steps over and over again until a less than cathartic finale . with nothing to build on over the last hour , the conclusion seems awkward and patched on . the secret lives of dentists takes a common theme and does nothing to improve upon it . altogether , a disappointing , unimaginative film .",0,1

marie perhaps to the least degree , because we see the least of her . alexandre's affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value , of course , but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean pierre l aud is most likely not even acting and that , with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray , he really was just reproducing word for word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he , along with the director eustache , had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film . i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100 of the film , it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow , worthless and despicable post '68 milieu . what made , however , this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us . if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman , sleeping mostly in this very flat with another , and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third , well , i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog eat dog world he's chosen to create for himself . what i can't , however , in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair . the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika , whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty . as i say , if la maman et la putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre , veronika and marie , three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home , then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching though why one should even feel like flinching once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i can't imagine . the problem , however , is that the director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander , veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings' emotional capabilities . this latter idea , however , is arrant and offensive nonsense . there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular . but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work . it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated , miserable , and alone , or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter . watch la maman et la putain if you're historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post '68 parisian milieu which was probably , unfortunately , not restricted to just a few particularly anti social types like these . but please don't make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have .",0,1

"to grasp where this 1976 version of a star is born is coming from consider this its final number is sung by barbra streisand in a seven minute and forty second close up , followed by another two and half minute freeze frame of ms . streisand striking a christ like pose behind the closing credits . over ten uninterrupted minutes of barbra's distinctive visage dead center , filling the big screen with uncompromising ego . that just might be some sort of cinematic record . or think about this the plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars , yet , while streisand's songs are performed in their entirety including the interminable finale her costar kris kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs . nor , though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties , do they actually sing a duet . or consider this streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times , including taking credit for musical concepts and her wardrobe from her closet and she also allegedly wanted , but failed to get co directing credit as well . one of her credits was as executive producer , with a producer credit going to her then boyfriend and former hairdresser , jon peters . as such , streisand controlled the final cut of the film , which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction . what it doesn't explain is how come , given every opportunity to make the great diva look good , their efforts only make streisand look bad . even though this was one of streisand's greatest box office hits , it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance . anyway , moving the melodrama from hollywood to the world of sex drugs and rock'n'roll , streisand plays esther hoffman , a pop singer on the road to stardom , who shares the fast lane for a while with kristofferson's john norman howard , a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to has beenville . in the previous incarnations of the story , norman maine sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer vicky lester achieve her success . in the feminist seventies , streisand co . want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man , so the trajectory is skewed ; she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one ; he's a burden she must endure in the name of love . as such , there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher , but almost ruthless , while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit . kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material ; making little attempt to give much of a performance , and oddly it serves his aimless , listless character well . streisand , on the other hand , exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen . everything she does seems , if not too rehearsed , at least too controlled . even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical . the two have no chemistry , making the central love affair totally unbelievable . you might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence , though at age 34 , streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive . the only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom . and , indeed , had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way , to make streisand's character openly play an exploitive villain , the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist . but i guess the filmmakers actually see esther as a sympathetic victim ; they don't seem to be aware just how cold blooded and self absorbed she is . but sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points note the petty joke of giving barbra two african american back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio the oreos . and the film makes a big deal of pointing out that esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of hoffman , yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from esther blodgett so that streisand won't be burdened with a name that is too jewish or too unattractive . so much for ethnic pride . the backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary , so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable . nominal director frank pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie , with considerable help from ace cinematographer robert surtees . and the film did serve its purpose , producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes including the oscar winning evergreen by paul williams and streisand . but overall the film turned out to be the one thing streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be , a vanity project .",0,1
"welcome to our town , welcome to your town ? as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 america , this three act play is opened before us with the help of the stage manager , a visual narrator if you like . after his initial introductions , we are lead into the homes of two particular families ; the webb's and the gibb's . this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century , and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town . here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of grover's corners , new hampshire , even if there are , too , the migrant polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers , they , never get a look in . once the daily lives of these families have been introduced ; wives cooking , children home working , fathers working , kids falling in love and the clean picket fences painted white , the second act is started three years later , after young george a young and unrecognisable william holden , then aged 22 and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry . blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching , too , a turning point in their own lives , from the nest they lived and now , into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step . the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding , it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent , here we see not life , not celebration but death , and it is in this predicament that the dead , as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past , are here to remind us , to tell us , that life , and every last minute , every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered . it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too , feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on , and by , middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order . this isn't just about our town , this is moral diction aimed at our souls and how america can better itself if its peoples' , excluding the poles , the irish , the native american and the freed ethnic minorities' , and minorities' in general , plus the supporting backbone of the americana's who , still , have not had a fair part in this narrative , such as the middle classes , can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest , decent living . the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only . i was entertained , slightly , by this movie too , but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting , the musical score or how well , or not , it was made . this was the movies intention to exclude other groups , and to only include the likes of the webb's and the gibb's , in the future of the developing country of the usa , a good movie , but also a slightly biased in its stance , i thought . taken from the play by us' born thornton wilder 1897 1975 this pulitzer prize winning play , and six academy award nominated movie , was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes ; life , love and death , the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness . our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness , like other towns , nothing too exciting ever happens here , if anything at all , this town only has the right sort of people , you can still leave your back door unlocked here , we are seeing the developing lives of these two families , but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves . our town may just have been any town , just as long as you came from the right part of town that is .",0,1

"very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of mary poppins 1964 and bedknobs and broomsticks 1971 . the human cast is very distinguished james mason , billie whitelaw , david tomlinson , joan greenwood , bernard cribbins but their roles range from the miscast a 69 year old mason as a thieving chimney sweep ! to the inconsequential greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat to the bizarre whitelaw plays several 'exotic' characters including a circus performer , an old hag , a maid and a fairy for no apparent reason . the animated segment of the film , handled by a group of east european animators , is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and , as usual , with this type of thing , there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with , one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good . the film was directed by noted character actor jeffries who had previously directed far more successfully other children's films namely the railway children 1970 and the amazing mr . blunden 1972 ; which i've yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on r2 dvd by anchor bay uk .",0,1

"i have read several reviews that ask the question , why was this film made ? i myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle , only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end , when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort . so , why was this film made ? i think that is a great question for those watching heftig og begeistret to ask themselves . this reviewer is proud of director knut erik jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope , brotherhood , and inspiration with this all male choir , but i do not think that jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table . let me pose this question to you , do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest ? my answer is yes , and this is where jensen failed . heftig og begeistret was a good documentary , but it was far from great . jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects . it was great to hear the songs , but over time , those songs seemed dull , overwhelming , and a bit precocious . from the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow , i knew that i was hooked , but as the film developed i lost interest . why ? jensen never took us , the audience members , to the next level . he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film . was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir ? the world may never know . again , i would like to state that jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music , but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created . jensen gave us the music superbly , but it was the characters , the subjects , that i knew nothing about by the end of the film . in the mix we had a 97 year old man who still had his driver's license , we had a large man in a tub singing classic american songs , we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth , we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers , and we even had an ex drug addict that had only been clean for eleven years . did jensen develop these interesting stories at all ? nope , he left them on the table . it was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it see the political man who missed his political days , but jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing . to me , the music was defined at the beginning of the film , i wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men . they were all captivating , yet jensen seemed to ignore them completely . by ignoring the major subjects of this documentary , jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end . without giving the ending away , i felt like jensen was coloring in the lines . instead of being bold outside the lines , he chose to create no moment of sympathy , emotion , nervousness , or sadness . jensen took our subjects from point a to point b to point c without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form . i can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in norway , but for everyone else watching i . e . me more was necessarily needed . i wanted to feel for these guys . i wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled , or just find themselves loved in their own city . there was no story , mostly in part to no development of the subjects . when you watch modern documentaries oddly , this film was made in 2001 , you want it to play out similar to any hollywood feature film . you want suspense , realism , and drama , alas , with heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sort . overall , i must ask the question again , why was this film made ? my final answer alex , is that jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of earth . i think that jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population . with that said , jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film , but he did not create a good documentary . when you make a film of this nature , i feel that you must look within the group , examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart . the only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed . again , i do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty , but i needed more . with documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community , one expects a bit more than what heftig og begeistret handed to us . i want to see reality and people , not just another song and dance routine ! grade out of",0,1

"okay , now i know where all those boring cop homicide tv shows came from . i do believe they can be traced back to this movie . scene of the crime feels more like a tv episode , or an episode of a serial . complete with stock characters and situations the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors . the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job , despite failing eyesight . the reckless rookie . the double crossing dame , etc . i like many of the actors here , and they do a good job , but overall i found this movie dull as i'm not a fan of the genre . i kept tuning out when they were discussing the case . something about bookies and informers . and oh yeah , there was a stripper , played by the previously wholesome gloria dehaven . what i want to know is why did she keep calling van johnson uncle wiggly ? wasn't uncle wiggly a rabbit ? a character from a children's book ? what the heck does that have to do with anything ? i guess i just don't get tough guy film noir ish kinda jargon . in fact , much of the dialogue made me mutter nobody talks like that ! however , i could relate to one scene where the cop's wife arlene dahl , who worries every time he goes to work , realizes that maybe she shouldn't have made her husband the center of her life . yeah , i know that feeling of loving someone so much , being so dependent on them , that there's a constant fear for their safety . so there are moments of truth in this film , underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self consciously to be gritty and real , that it actually seems unreal to me . a little background this movie was made when dore schary took over mgm from louis b . mayer , and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made mgm so great . dore schary was determined to bring more realism to movies . i kinda hate dore schary . maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious , bleak movies being made today , wallowing in the ugly truths about life , focusing on and , in my opinion , helping to perpetuate the worst of humanity rather than the best . no longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do providing a necessary distraction during the great depression and world war ii . well , damn it , we still need that kind of distraction today ! there's still plenty of depression and plenty of war . and what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape ? trashy , brain deadening reality tv . thanks a lot , dore !",0,1
"this movie should have been called the eyes of alexander , and they should have done away with the bogart concept altogether . the film started out with a lighthearted approach to bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face , but after the first 15 30 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller , where two palm size sapphires , purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of alexander the great , for him , and seen by him , right before his death . so the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size , but also because of the tie to the greatest conquerer the world has ever known . being an expert on alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction , but it makes for a good movie anyway . so the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of alexander allusions in both the foreground and background which i really liked , ending with a dated shark attack you couldn't go to a movie in '79 '80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience . there is a yacht named euridice alexander's father's young wife , a man named alexander , philip , cleitus ? , it's been about 5 years since i've seen the film , so can't remember all the details , olympias , some street names , and many others . it was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director obviously an alexanderphile himself put in . when all is said and done , the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by . kind of a neat ending . what would have been more fun would be if they went the indiana jones way and had an action adventure . there were many , many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting , or instance , the hand annotated by aristotle version of the iliad that alexander kept with him all his life , even on his many journeys across asia would be of incalculable value if found today . olivia hussey my all time favorite b movie actress is killed off way too early , and should have been the main actress throughout , not the girl from the momma's and the poppa's . though she was herself easy on the eyes . if you can find this flick , it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see olivia hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on , but beyond that , i'd pass on it for something more entertaining . yours , nick",0,1

"one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3 strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria gambarelli ! i half wondered if blake edwards was naming the character played by elke sommer in a shot in the dark after this now forgotten performer though the spelling of the sommer character's surname was actually gambrelli . i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing la cucaracha . that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances like that of ms . gambarelli that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy devine as a great bull fighter yeah , right ! and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume . only funny part of those two is when they cry with buster providing handkerchief to bull during the sad part of la cucaracha . also lame was seeing ted healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking healy for other movie stars . healy himself didn't know zeppo had left the marx brothers since he puts four between the and marx ! speaking of a marx , it was interesting seeing harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head . also interesting was seeing ida lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the vanities last year at least when announcer pete smith identified her . oh , and smith himself wasn't funny with his wise guy narration . other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are m g m contract players either ! so with all that said , la fiesta de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy garland's early film appearances or the early use of 3 strip technicolor .",0,1

"i very much looked forward to this movie . its a good family movie ; however , if michael landon jr .

"this series , made for televisi n espa ola tve is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968 , primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son . based on a background of historical events , such as the may 1968 student uprising in france , the decaying franco regime , the war in viet nam , the rise of imperialism , and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment , one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment . generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic , the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times , as , it should be stated , anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things . the best thing that can be said of this series is ana duato's r le as mother of three children she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well , manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant , especially noticeable among women , of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart , without any resorting to the use of the brain . as we say in spain , common sense is one of the least common senses . imanol arias offers very little , apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series . indeed , as an actor , he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series . his resources are too limited ; however , his part as father of the working class household is not at all bad . not really recommendable for other audiences , even spanish speakers in latin america the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history , such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references . it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers .",0,1

"this is a pretty simplistic romance . girl finds boy , girl loves boy , girl loses boy , girl finds boy . colleen moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe , delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic romantic performance , well deserving of an oscar nom . equally fine are the aerial combat special effects . moore plays a french girl whose mother has turned over their field to a british aerial squadron during wwi . she is the daughter of the regiment , loved as a little sister . into this mix comes a fill in for a downed flyer , gary cooper . at first they hate each other , then they love each other , then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission . cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him . moore searches for him , is told at a hospital he is dead , then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited . it's a nice little romance , but hardly more than that . recommended for fans of ms . moore and mr . cooper",0,1

"possible spoilers from dreamworks and director peter chan , the love letter' is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque , new england coastal village where single mom helen kate capshaw owns a quaint , little bookstore . one day at work , helen happens across an anonymous letter the love letter' of the title that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch . upon reading the amorous prose therein , she believes it has been written to her , purposely placed in the couch for her to find , and , for reasons of her own , thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer . inadvertently , however , helen leaves the letter out where her employee , janet ellen degeneres finds it , believes it to be for her , and , of course , thinks she knows who wrote it . circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named johnny tom everett scott , who thinks helen has written the letter to him . and before it all gets sorted out , you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast ; and i do mean imagine , because the way this movie plays out , the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself . there are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably it simply isn't very romantic , and it's not funny ; and that is a potent combination that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits . once the setting and main character helen have been established , it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so . by the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter , and to whom , you could care less . rounding out the cast is tom selleck , blythe danner , julianne nicholson , gloria stuart and geraldine mcewan . it's a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this , and looking bad in the balance . kate capshaw , who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up , looks tired here , while selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender that's lasted a week . ellen degeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch . it is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination . in the case of the love letter , ' however , it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place . i rate this one 1 10 .",0,1

"it's hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts , but i know that humor is very subjective . i have seen all of their sound shorts by far the best of their stuff imo and i found this one of their weaker efforts . in the year this was made 1930 stan and babe made 15 shorts and one feature . they were extremely popular and their boss hal roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly . in addition , this was a time of experimentation for the writers and stan . i would say this was an experiment that really did not work . as someone else said , it does not play to their strengths . too much dialog and plot . the best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with stan as agnes the maid and the great thelma todd talking about girl stuff . if you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out blotto , or brats from the same year . they made so many shorts in such a short time that i think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts . they made something like 108 films altogether . very few except for the ones made at fox were outright failures but there are some . county hospital , me and my pal , the live ghost , the fixer uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones . but other then those i find something wonderful in just about all their shorts . quite a record in my book . if you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out , but i would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to stan and babe .",0,1

"this is a review of the later english release by disney , featuring alison lohman , patrick stewart , and co . i really wanted this film to be good . really , really . i'm a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away , and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film , i was eager to see it . but i was shocked , shocked i say , at the quality of this film . those later films boast well crafted plots , 3 dimensional characters , and the best film music since . well . ever . this film just doesn't come close . might as well start w the positive aspects , though . like all miyazaki films , this one is still very imaginative , with a bizarre fantasy sci fi setting , in a post apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species . nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time . though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazaki's later films and the english voice acting is quite well done . but this film . just . isn't . good . the characters are all cardboard from saccharine sweet little nausicaa , to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians , to everyone in between . once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds , you've seen all there is . and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesn't help . then there's the music . now , hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer , but nausicaa doesn't do him justice . half the music is 80's keyboards on overdrive , and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them . i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture . but wait ! there's a great message with this film , right ? ! let's all save the environment ! too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer . there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree . no , really . i ain't kidding . it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is . but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it . and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on , that's lame . if you're the kind of person who worships anime , enjoys 80's music , and plants a tree every arbor day , you will probably like this film . otherwise , save your money for his later films , because they rock big time .",0,1

"first a warning . i recently saw this movie on dvd in the universal 'hitchcock collection' series . the source print looks to be in immaculate condition , but the image is a bit soft , suggesting it might be a second generation copy straight from video . the framing is far too tight , so all the compositions are terrible . even the title of the movie is cropped . i gather from other imdb reviews that there is a much better version available . mr and mrs smith is just a footnote to hitchcock's career . in his lengthy interviews with francois truffaut in the sixties , hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his whole body of work , but all he could say about this picture is that he did it as a favour to carole lombard and that he didn't understand the characters so just photographed norman krasna's screenplay . in truth , there is not much more that needs to be said . it is a screwball comedy out of the same mould as it happened one night , his girl friday and philapdelphia story . carole lombard is a typically feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid , falls out with with her husband on the flimsiest of pretexts and spends most of the picture being 'adorably' unreasonable . robert montgomery does well enough as the put upon husband , but it is hard not to lose patience with him . long before the end of the movie the audience is saying dump the silly cow , she's not worth it . gene raymond plays the best friend with whom she becomes engaged . he is supposed to be a courtly , 'old family' southerner , although this is not obvious from his accent and only really becomes apparent in the drunk scene which he otherwise plays very well . he is an honourable , generous , teetotal gentleman , so of course he is bullied and patronised by robert montgomery and made the butt of many of the jokes although he is not as badly treated as the similar ralph bellamy character in his girl friday . this movie feels like it was made by people who only knew of screwball comedies by reputation , but hadn't actually seen one . for example , a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of on going comic threads that continually intertwine and overlap . here , all the comedy elements are just strung out , like beads on a necklace . this is screwball comedy by the numbers . it is the same with the direction . typically , these comedies race along at an ever increasing pace that rises to near hysteria by the end . hitchcock doesn't get this . his direction is somewhat lethargic and the picture becomes a stately succession of scenes that all seem slightly over written but under nourished and slightly too long . he was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it . they do ok . hitchcock had a good sense of humour , which he frequently used in his thrillers , but he had no feel for comedy as a genre . his later trouble with harry was also a misfire , for similar reasons to this movie , but at least he was involved in that picture . here he is just going through the motions . all the people connected with this movie were good solid professionals so it is not especially bad . it just feels a bit derivative , over familiar , over long and ultimately rather flat . mr and mrs smith is one for carole lombard fans and hitchcock completists only .",0,1
"i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely , i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story . while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors . 1 . speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie . in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe . 2 . the asian nurse who survived speck's massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie . this would have been impossible . in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims . 3 . the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them . not true . in reality speck was at first calm and gentle , reassuring the women he wasn't going to hurt them . this is how he was able to tie each of them up . 4 . the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be . fbi profiler robert ressler interviewed speck in the 80's and said that speck not only did'nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why . speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie . if the story wasn't so tragic and horrifying , the voice over would be laughable . all in all , doug cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold blooded even though i don't think the real speck was so forward in his violence . no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known , after all , for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them . beverly ann sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film . she is a very good actress . if you are at all squeamish , do not see this film . it's very graphic and disturbing .",0,1

"i admired rob marshall for chicago , but memoirs of geisha turns out to be yet another failure of combing western and asian arts . overall , the scene is beautiful , but after restless emphasis on exoticism oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them . the excessive cherry blossom was , frankly , overdone . it's probably the cultural difference of perception here the ultimate beauty is not the showy type , as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie . some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws . as a taiwanese , i have no doubt the actress are great . an actor actress can play any kind of role when he she can look like it . gong li is great , but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into japanese style . all i saw was a bittersweet and jealous chinese woman . michlle yeoh , one of my favourtie actress , did not even look like a japanese . some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate , feminine characteristics of japanese women , with which i can't agree more . these are so delicate that i assume not even all modern japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in geisha , let alone the two chinese and one malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know japanese culture that much . geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of american audiences . but it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the oscar for best costume , best director or best picture .",0,1
"disappointing and irritating . the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clich s in a disjointed fashion . character is not explored in depth . these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element , the mother's affair with her daughter's lover . anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines , such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye . the script portrays darren daniel craig as a dr . jekyll mr . hyde without any hints about why , except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene . a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic .",0,1
"the nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet . it bears little resemblance to eta hoffman's original story on which it is based . in the ballet , the story is essentially over by the second half when clara or marie in this version travels to the kingdom of sweets to watch a series of character dances . there's an infinite variety of stage productions that re interpret the story in myriad ways not always successfully to compensate for the ballet's weak libretto . balanchine's version doesn't really have any sense of drama or story at all despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in tchaikovsky's wonderful first act music . the result is a completely forgettable first half christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing the little that there is of it isn't particularly memorable . the pantomime over acting , particularly of drosselmeier , which might look passable on the stage , just looks silly filmed for the big screen . unfortunately , things aren't much better when we get to the kingdom of sweets act ii in the stage version . although there are a few choreographic highlights , most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring . this certainly isn't vintage balanchine . balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance , but i have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets . watching this film version of his stage production of the nutcracker has only re affirmed this view .",0,1
"i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie bella martha mostly martha , and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one . i miss the slow pace , the build up of characters and their style in small gestures , the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog . i don't think that the story itself is enough . martha kate is more secluded , and mario nick is not a clown . in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original , its is not working in its copy here . the small alterations take away the tension . my opinion is that you should go and see the original . it'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles .",0,1

"this film is just another distortion , among many distortions , on the so called 'sins of consumerism' . please note that 'reverend billy' , an actor bill talen , is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the 'sins of consumerism' . we might want to ask are questions , like what does 'reverend billy' do for a living ? how does he make his money ? does he make his living off his 'tax deductible' organization ? how does the internal revenue justify this as a 'tax deductible' church or organization ? everyone knows that christmas is commercialized , but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable , and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families , friends , or extended families . everyone is not charitable . everyone does not spend time with their families , friends , or extended families . but , holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity . yes , america does have more than its share of problems but , with perseverance , americans have and always make it through great difficulties . and , even in times of strife , america has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world . that happens when americans pull together and unite , rather than to separate and divide . yes , there are problems with corporations and monopolies , but it will take americans to bring back the small businesses , along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities . yes , globalization has brought us its share of problems , but it will take americans to bring production back to america . americans and the u . s . government need to learn how to stay on a budget , no matter how large or small it may be , and we must stop our dependence on credit . our over reliance on credit will make , and keep us poor , from the cradle to the grave . it is important to buy but , if we buy less , we will rely less on credit . and , if we are able to save , even a small amount of money , we will have money for a rainy day . not to say that , as americans , we will gain an equal share of wealth . wealth is not guaranteed , and has never been guaranteed . but , stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of americans hold most of america's wealth . there is a good proximity that you or i can reach the level of the upper , middle class . and , who knows what can happen from there ? ! ? be positive , work hard and , at the very least , you and i will be able to reach at least some if not all of our dreams . in life , nothing is guaranteed , but we always have that something to reach for . and , if you or i don't have dreams , we might as well be dead . in america , there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams . as individuals , we are a part of the pack , but we always can become the leader of the pack . it has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions , but i pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs , values , and perspectives . but , as far as the distortions expressed , within this film , i do not have any faith in such beliefs , values , and perspectives . i rank this film with a 1 out of 10 but , in all honesty and truth , this film deserves a zero . this film has no integrity , and i cannot recommend it .",0,1

"the running jumping standing still film is not a film as such , but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme . this 'film' got richard lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first beatles film 'a hard day's night . richard lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959 . this film was entitled the running , jumping , standing still film . it was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production . since the film was intended to be viewed by lester and his partners alone , a small amount of money and time was invested . the sole purpose of this film is entertainment , but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera . the film cost 70 to make , and it was filmed in sepia toned film stock in a field on a couple of sundays . all of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production ; the finished production is eleven minutes in length . the running , jumping , standing still film is a comedy about english sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time . all of the events in this film take place in a field . a few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn , a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record , a photographer developing film in a pond , an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model's face , a man building a tent , an athlete running over the tent , and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun . not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away , but it also pokes fun at english culture when compared to american culture . another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite , which has been constructed out of the flag of the united kingdom . one of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it , and the kite breaks . according to neil sinyard , author of the films of richard lester , this event symbolizes the united kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the united states during the space age . according to this scene , the british fly primitive kites while the americans , the world power after world war ii , fly highly advanced rockets and space shuttles .",0,1

"i don't remember too much about this movie except that there was a distinctly gratuitous destruction of luminaires lamps . almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and wanton destruction of useful light fixtures , even if outfitted with cheesy , '70's style , cylindrical shades to keep with the time setting of the story . on one occasion , raucous lamp destruction takes place in a domestic fight scene between the brothers in both the living and dining rooms of their mother's house , with fixtures in both rooms being taken out . yet , the most malicious destruction occurs moments later in a bookie's office and includes , but is not limited to , the toppling of a fixture with a ceramic horse head base , which is consequently disintegrated , and the severe denting of a cylindrical shade as a guy falls back into it during another fisticuffs fight . later , that lamp is toppled as well when the guy is shot , incurring further damage to the plastic coated shade . while this movie encourages a particularly wasteful attitude toward lamps , one should keep in mind that lamps , regardless of their cheap construction or gauche , top heavy appearance , are still valuable for the illumination that they provide . however , if you ever feel the need to vicariously smash a lamp , i would highly recommend this movie .",0,1
"mount godwin austin otherwise known as k2 is the world's second highest mountain , and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed . k2 is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering . while the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery , the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore and therein lies the fault with the whole film . cocksure lawyer taylor brooks michael biehn and his quiet married friend harold jamieson matt craven spend their free time rock climbing . during one of their trips , they meet up with another bunch of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast philip claibourne raymond j . barry . claibourne's team are in training for a forthcoming shot at the infamous k2 , a mountain that taylor and harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so . during their training run , however , two of claibourne's team get themselves killed in an avalanche . taylor and harold put themselves forward as potential replacements . despite initial reluctance , claibourne gives them the nod of approval and the pair find themselves joining his team in the himalayas . harold's wife cindy julia nickson soul is distraught that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb , especially since he has recently become a father . tensions in the climbing team mount as taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group , the equally brash and arrogant dallas woolf luca bercovici . meanwhile , claibourne himself grows increasingly ill as altitude sickness takes its toll on his body . will the guys reach the peak of k2 , or is their quest destined to end in disappointment , or even death ? k2 spends an inordinately long time introducing its somewhat dislikeable characters . biehn as a foul mouthed , pushy , adventurous type is especially hard to like , as is barry as the hard nosed mountaineering millionaire . but on the other side of the coin , craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb k2 heck , she'd be better off if he never came back ! rounding off the main characters is bercovici , whose characterisation as dallas woolf is as campy and over the top as every other role he's ever played . the story itself is totally tame and disposable just a straightforward yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain . there's a bit of male bonding thrown in , but the whole subplot about harold and his wife amounts to nil , and the personality clashes between taylor and dallas ring totally false . k2 scores its few merits solely from the stunning cinematography by gabriel berastain during the himalayan sequences , the scale and awe of the mountains is quite nicely captured . i'm completely with critic kim newman on this one , who hilariously stated in empire magazine on this evidence , climbing k2 can't be any harder than sitting through it ! quite true , kim , quite true !",0,1
"i don't understand the exaggerated good critics about this film , except that a lot of people from venezuela are understandably very excited , based on that the venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the region . the movie first of all is too repetitive , a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles , so you get the impression that it's a time filler . a time filler is also a good point , as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes , you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clock . all actors are quite bad , by exception of the venezuelan guy edgar ramirez , who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the venezuelan recruit pedro . by the way , this is not a representative movie about the people of the region caribean zone , it tends to ridicules them .",0,1

"despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes . where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants ? not on the payroll apparently . a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes . in a later conversation she said , imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates . worse imagine dressing the scarlet o'hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo . maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was missing the hoop or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair , but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears . and be laughing in the aisles . excellent story and photography be damned . so . watching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances , actual geisha or japanese dress , and that was the topic of the movie ! hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making . they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong . i thought the last samurai was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be . memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time .",0,1

"what symbolism ! exclaimed a woman as we exited the theater after viewing the polish brother's paean to ingmar bergman . some symbolism is there all right . but not much . northfork adds up to some fine acting weakened by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that irritates rather than enthralls . northfork is a town facing extinction after a new hydroelectric dam goes into operation . it's the early to middle 1950s and a squad of identically dressed state agents , all looking as if they had just answered a casting call for the untouchables , have the job of relocating recalcitrant dwellers who fail to appreciate both their immediate peril as well as the proffered bounty for moving . an exciting anti development movie is always a possibility but let's get real rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a boosted economy in american history . dams can be built without forced relocation ? not in this country . but this film is less about the plight of homeowners than it is a fantastical creation of a dying young boy's escapist imagination . nick nolte is the priest who tends to the lad and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear . alternating between the black suited evacuation agents working for lakefront land when the dam creates that valuable acreage and a phantasmagorical collection of weirdos , the film develops neither theme coherently or even interestingly . the cinematography is poor . a washed out , subdued and depressive color permeates the whole film to little dramatic purpose . there is no reason for this vast terrain to be depicted so bleakly . indeed , a contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and grim solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective . 4 10 .",0,1

"when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago , it would have been something quite different for the time . so therefor some people would have found it quite scary , and may well have been impressed with the special effects ? looking at the play in this day and age , it doesn't seem to be all that scary anymore , even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired . would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel ? i don't think so . but if you watch this play again , you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel , rushes straight through the red light ! maybe that's how it was in dickens time ? you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state . surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting . i can't help but notice things like that i will not take anything away from the acting , both denholm elliott signalman and bernard lloyd the traveller gave wonderful performances . i am not at all sure what is going on . i mean was the ghost the traveller , or what ? does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story ? well maybe i am the only one that don't ? to sum up . the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout , with great character . it suffers from not being that scary these days , and a little if not very confusing in places , and has some rather unusual signalling practises . thanks for reading my review .",0,1

"i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together , the talk is not of the master's great films like north by northwest or strangers on a train , but a lesser known effort like this one from 1931 , obscure and seriously flawed , which showcases the great director in fledgling form . emily and fred hill joan barry and harry kendall are a middle class london couple scrimping to stay ahead . he begrudges their lot ; she accepts it . change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle , saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury . they make plans for a world cruise . but their problems have only begun . just ask richard hannay , roger o . thornhill , or marion crane . well , marion's indisposed at the moment , but you get the idea . travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight , setting one up for a perilous journey at best . this is perhaps hitchcock's earliest foray into this theme , and not his most successful or memorable . hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element , in this case domestic drama rather than suspense , but the two do not cohere , at least not here . the hills are a dull , flat couple , with no chemistry or personality . when they find themselves at the folies berg re , in the form of cross cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film , they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers . the curtain's gone up too soon ! gasps emily . they aren't dressed . when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise , it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing , even if the people they partner off with are drips , too . emily's man , gordon percy marmont carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs , which he suggests be filled by emily . fred's girl the princess betty amann has clara bow's eyes and wallace beery's five o'clock shadow . there's also an obnoxious fellow passenger , a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue . subtlety was still to come . everything is shot in an abrupt manner , with confusing blocking and strained dialogue . hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn't come off , and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears . when fred and emily break off , they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged together rickshaws , one of many clunky attempts at symbolism . emily's the only vaguely sympathetic character , in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon , but mostly because she's among the first of hitchcock's many magnetic blondes , her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film's conclusion . matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set piece for the protagonists to come to grips with , and presumably repair their relationship . only they aren't active participants in the resolution , and except for the fate of a friendly cat , nothing about the ending resonates . at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s , and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food . rich and strange is hitchcock paying his dues , and learning his trade , one for scholars but not casual film goers .",0,1
"i have to admit i laughed a few times during this trivial 2004 holiday movie , but it's already moving out of my short term memory . in a career that is sliding rather swiftly toward tabloid obscurity , ben affleck , once a promising comic character actor who became enmeshed in the hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man . judging from this film , the transformation doesn't seem to be taking , as he continues to lack the gravitas that would make him credible in such parts . while his buddy matt damon takes on smart roles in films like syriana , affleck appears in this type of commercial pap . at least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive drew latham suits affleck better than most of the other roles he has tried . directed by mike mitchell whose most famous film is 1999's deuce bigelow male gigolo and scripted by no less than four screenwriters always a bad sign , the flimsy plot revolves around his character's need to rent a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the old fashioned christmas he never had . the concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the cathartic release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the frenzied commercialism around the holidays . the real problem , however , is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional resonance . affleck seems to be on overdrive attempting desperately to be lovable , but the net result is an exhausting turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in ill conceived films . fortunately , he has the likes of james gandofini and catherine o'hara playing the valcos , the couple who decide to accept drew's monetary offer to pretend to be his parents . gandolfini plays tom like a gruff , non violent relative of tony soprano , but he does what he can in the role . from her classic sctv days to christopher guest's mockumentaries , o'hara is always a comic gem no matter the vehicle , and unsurprisingly she earns the best laughs as tom's wife christine , whether dryly delivering a one liner or posing in an inch of make up for a dominatrix photo shoot . in what is becoming her standard screen role , christina applegate plays their mistrusting daughter alicia , who of course becomes drew's love interest . despite some good moments where she is enjoying the deceit of playing drew's sister in front of his girlfriend's family , her character seems to change in lightning flash strokes making it hard to see what drew would see in her . the story spins completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation piled on top of another until plot strands are tied together in short order . it's rumored that much of the movie was improvised since there was no finished shooting script . it shows , but i also have to admit i stuck with it to the bitter end .",0,1
"when i saw this documentary , i was disappointed to see serbian propaganda in action once again . even though serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of yugoslavian breakup , it is not mentioned in this documentary , which is made by bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective . it is one in the set of lies pushed by milosevic regime . everyone else is guilty only serbians were right and victims , even though most of the war criminals tried in hague are serbs , even though serbs are one who have committed genocide against bosnians , and attacked slovenia , croatia , and bosnia all independent nations recognized by the un . breakup of yugoslavia was not avoidable because serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on federal yugoslav government , so slovenia , croatia , macedonia , and bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests . if you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of yugoslavia , and fact led documentary this is not it . you should watch yugoslavia death of a nation , made by discovery channel and bbc .",0,1
"this was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting mainly from the supporting characters . the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film itself . hugh laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool . the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment . if you have never seen rio , or the inside of a british bank , this film is for you . 2 out of 10 .",0,1
"i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe strummer and the mescaleros . i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that . but i came out of the theatre not knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on wikipedia . the movie never really gets through to the person , his thoughts and feelings . what they did was to collect the little material that they had , shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about joe strummer at a camp fire . it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all , and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say , oh , he was such an inspiration to all of us . like bono or johnny depp whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the caribbean . it seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart that ever lived , sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him . sure , being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band , hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such , but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe strummer could have easily been told in 60 90 minutes . go see the movie if you are a fan , otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the undeservedly unknown mescaleros , where joe strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death , melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound .",0,1
"john boorman's 1998 the general was hailed as a major comeback , though it's hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself . one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin cahill alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles , it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in b w scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever . with a main character who threatens witnesses , car bombs doctors , causes a hundred people to lose their jobs , tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a m nage a trios with her sister , it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film . it doesn't get it . instead , it's lumbered with what may well be brendan gleeson's worst and most disinterested performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there's nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character . on the plus side , this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug , but it's at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics . there's a minor section that picks up interest when the ira whips up a local hate campaign against the 'general' and his men , painting them as 'anti social' drug dealers purely because cahill won't share his loot from a robbery with them , but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot something to do with cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we're expected to find lovably cheeky that it's just thrown away . things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart , but by then it's too late to really care . adrian dunbar , maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous angeline ball do good work in adoring supporting roles , but jon voight's hammy garda beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance , overcompensating for gleeson's comatose non involvement in what feels like a total misfire . come back zardoz , all is forgiven .",0,1

"i had never even heard of one dark night until someone mentioned it on a horror message board here recently , and reading into it , i gained interest due to meg tilly's involvement and recognizing that it was an early gig for friday the 13th vi jason lives director tom mcloughlin . unfortunately , sad to say , it's nothing special . the premise has a familiarity to it a college girl must survive the night in an old mausoleum until morning in order to join a sorority . that girl is a young meg tilly , as julie , who wishes to prove to her loving , caring boyfriend , steve david mason daniels that she can make his cruel , conniving ex girlfriend , carol's robin evans sorority regardless of the tactics she pulls in order to see her fail . along with carol's gang is kitty leslie speights , always with a toothbrush in her mouth , and leslie elizabeth daily who doesn't really wish to cause julie such trouble . while leslie insists on leaving julie alone as she remains in the mausoleum , carol and kitty plan to torment the poor girl . meanwhile steve searches for her while julie , carol and kitty encounter an evil they couldn't possibly imagine . the corpse of a recently diseased psychic vampire , whose telekinesis was of a dangerously powerful degree , will seek to drain them of their very lifeforce . the only one who can help these girls is the dead man's daughter , olivia melissa newman who is equipped with the same psychic power he has . i think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum , it's certainly different than what you normally see in the slashers that were out at this time . like adam west's character . he was the cynical husband of olivia who found the idea of her father's power ridiculous , i had a really hard time adjusting to the tacky plot , and i personally never found anything within the film to get excited about . the mausoleum to me never really was that spooky . it doesn't really achieve the same kind of eerie quality phantasm captured and the corpses which are used to attack the girls are laughably unconvincing . there is one great scene where a corpse's face melts away . i have a soft spot for low budget films from this period of time , but i just never really could find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfying undead corpse shooting electric bolts from it's eyes causing other bodies to break free from their crypts to obey their master . it's just too silly to take seriously . carol is your typical blond bitch wishing to punish a nice girl who is dating a former flame . steve is your typical , squeaky clean all american boyfriend , handsome and tender , who becomes the hero seeking to save his girl from whatever sinister forces are at play . to make up for the small budget director mcloughlin tries every trick in the book to thrill the audience , using a series of ooga booga effects such as corpses which pursue young girls , chairs which shake and tremble , doors that slam shut , and objects levitating by themselves . the film obviously has it's fans , and i am glad i had a chance to see it , but i was a bit disappointed that one dark night wasn't the horror sleeper i hoped for . adam west has a very small role as the concerned husband hoping his wife will snap out of her depressed state regarding a father who had nothing to do with her . melissa newman is the troubled olivia , recognizing that she must stop her father once and for all or else he'd continue to prey on the living . donald hotton is dockstader , an associate of olivia's father's who informs her of what he was . i wasn't particularly blown away by tilly's performance here . she was basically scared most of the time , but she'd get a chance to prove herself to a greater degree from this point onward . this will undoubtedly be of some value to those who watched it back at that time , for nostalgia purposes it might seduce fans of movies from this era .",0,1
"peter yates film from the pen of steve tesich is a relatively low key thriller that doesn't really manage to get off the ground . story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential asian business man and the subsequent implication of a pathetic vietnam veteran james woods who , the police believe , may have taken revenge on his ex employer . as the eyewitness , william hurt never believes his friend is capable of such an act . hurt is well below his usual strength , and one finds it hard to sympathise with him or an uninspired sigourney weaver . james woods and christopher plummer do a little better in their support roles . worth noting is the appearance of morgan freeman as detective black . in retrospect steve tesich's story is only an unlikely romance dressed up as a mystery flick . the plot is far too contrived . friday , october 17 , 1997 video",0,1
"only the glandular secretions and please don't ask for any more details of young virgins can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalist's wife fresh and youthful . since , like most people except those taking part in medical trials , virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly , dr . lorenz bela lugosi arranges for them to be abducted and preserved . he'll do the extracting himself . what a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie . if the corpse vanishes turns out not to be the havarti of horror , as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste . sure , the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf angelo rossitto , who later played the master in mad max beyond thunderdome ; his crazed brute of a brother , angel frank moran , who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair ; the crazed mother of the two minerva urecal ; the crazed wife elizabeth russell , who sleeps in a plush coffin and , of course , the crazed doctor lugosi . an enterprising young reporter , patricia hunter luana walters tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been worn by the victims . when the doctor and his wife invite pat to stay the night , a raging storm immediately breaks out . that clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside . since it's well known that in hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins , pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with . they include dark passages , a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored , a basement mausoleum and , later , a direct threat to patricia's own glandular secretions . if she survives , what a story she'll have to give her editor . if you sample this moist slice of moldy velveeta and why not ? don't be superior , don't judge bela lugosi by the company he keeps here . he had a huge impact in dracula 1931 , but my favorite movie of his is the black cat 1934 . as dr . vitas werdegast he's a sad , ironic man protective of his two young friends . when he finally takes a scalpel to hjalmar poelzig boris karloff and begins to flay the man alive , ah , well , it's a great scene .",0,1

"i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan . i decided to watch it myself earlier this week . it is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines . the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two . she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships . she literally bumps into brian kerwin a regular married guy with kids after driving her car into the back of his . after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive . romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out . what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plot . the other section involves an old studio boss played by darren mcgavin . this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan , lois chiles , steven bauer stella stevens . they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign , they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere . it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me . i am not a michelle pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress . overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine .",0,1

"i agree with the majority of the comments i have seen written . i grew up watching seseme street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born . i was born in 1964 , so i was 5 yrs old when seseme street was introduced to television . the show taught me my numbers the count , spelling the muppet , and about life . i liked all the old characters big bird , oscar , grover , and cookie monster and don't quite understand why they had to change . i understand that everything has to change in some way , but to make cookie monster into a veggie monster to promote healthy eating . the show has introduced new characters and monsters since it's inception , why not make a separate veggie monster that talks discusses the benefits of eating a varied diet with cookie monster . but , back to my point . i grew up watching the very beginning of seseme street , my now 20 yr old daughter grew up watching ss with me along side her , and we discussed mr . hooper dying , although he had died prior to her being born , as well as other topics on the show . i saw the episode as a older child , and still remember how well they portrayed the event , much like real life . and i'm sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and losses effect families . you saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events . the show has talked about traditional families , adoptive families and combined families . it's one of the few shows that actually discusses these scenarios . i now have a 5 yr old daughter who really doesn't watch ss . i've tried to watch the show a couple of times , but , it really is not what it used to be . the elmo 1 2 hr with mr . noodle is absolutely ridiculous . like many people have said , it doesn't teach anything . it's geared for the less than 18 month old maybe , and isn't even funny . i always prided myself on watching ss as a child , teen , and adult with my own child . now on my second go round , i really have a hard time watching ss . the topics that were discussed death , marriage , non traditional families , new to neighborhoods , moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for 2 99 year old to understand and relate to . now , there are no concepts taught , minimal counting , only the occasional mention of the alphabet . it is not the same ss , from an original watcher of the show . please if any producers from the show read these comments , return the show to its foundation . new concepts have never been a problem with ss , they just used to have a better way to incorporate them into the show .",0,1

"this was hitchcock's third hollywood feature , and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency , turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in rebecca , to espionage thriller in foreign correspondent , and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the screwball pictures of the 1930s . hitchcock's formal method , on the other hand , had by now settled into something consistent , so much so that he was unable or at least unwilling to deviate from it . it was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre , and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate . in rebecca it was actually great to see hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text , forced to turn his technique to heavy gothic drama , but for mr and mrs smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content . in other words , hitchcock was no ernst lubitsch . first , let's look at the romantic angle . the best love scenes in hitchcock films were wild , passionate and slightly dangerous the ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have ? situation , and he was great at depicting that . this is something that makes a much earlier film , rich and strange , one of the few hitchcock non thrillers that really works . hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story . a light , tender touch is required and hitch doesn't have it . secondly , take the comedy . of course , hitchcock films could be funny the lady vanishes is probably the best example but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story . the master of suspense simply isn't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones . he cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller snappy opposing angles of people talking , inserted close ups of hands and feet , point of view shots but doesn't allow for comic timing or focus on gags . for example , the business with carole lombard's dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close ups , but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point , and have no comedic impact . occasionally hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club , where robert montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive , sophisticated woman at the next table but such moments are few and far between . even the cast of mr and mrs smith are not up to standard . i'm not sure this was robert montgomery's strength lay , and he is boring here . this was of course exactly where queen of screwball carole lombard's strength lay , and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances . even jack carson , who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera , fails to perk things up at all . of course , neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay , which isn't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place , even if the basic story is a fairly good premise . the only full on comedy hitchcock made after this was the trouble with harry , and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness . however it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour , when the basic framework was suspense as it is in the lady vanishes or family plot that hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well .",0,1
"i just recently viewed shame which is directed by ingmar bergman . the film was interesting and very unique . i liked how it was in swedish with english subtitles and that it was also in black and white . these features allowed me to better relate to the characters , the time period , and their stories . i didn't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you didn't know what was really going on . at first , it was mainly a story of eva and jan's relationship . the movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all of the conflicts and changes throughout the movie . i probably would not go see shame again , but it was a very cultured experience .",0,1

"if the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless , one might well refer to ned kelly as an australian western . for the people down under , ned kelly was , apparently , a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood , jesse james , bonnie and clyde , and butch cassidy and the sundance kid . the descendant of irish immigrants , kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer , a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison . to get back at the government for this mistreatment , kelly , his brother dan , and two other companions , became notorious bank robbers , winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country . perhaps because we've encountered this gentleman bandit scenario so many times in the past , ned kelly feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clich s on its way to the inevitable showdown . ned is the typical heart of gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and , even then , only with the deepest regret . he also has the pulse of the common folk , as when , in the middle of a bank robbery , he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers , after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it . what movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that ? it's acts of selective generosity like this , of course , that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers that be and the status quo . geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment . there's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers , so turned on is she by the romantic derring do of the criminal lifestyle . and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another . heath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role , providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging . it doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film . ned kelly might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history , but as an entertainment , it's just the same old story told with different accents .",0,1

"this adaptation , like 1949's the heiress , is based on the henry james novel . the heiress , starring olivia de havilland , remains as a well respected piece of work , though less true to james' original story than this new remake , which retains james' original title . it is the story of a awkward , yet loving daughter leigh , devoted to her father finney after her mother dies during childbirth . the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever , and considers her , as well as all women , simpleminded . when a young man chaplin of good family and little fortune comes courting , the father is naturally suspicious , but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man , is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him . leigh is a controversial actress most either love her or hate her and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style , like she's acting through gritted teeth . she's not bad in this , and she handles her role relatively deftly it's just an awkward role for any actress , making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses . while the character garners a lot of sympathy , she's not particularly likable . the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin previously seen in the truth about cats and dogs plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune , or is really in love with her . maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well meaning aunt . finney is marvelous , of course , as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience , but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves . but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune ? this is only one instance where washington square differs from the heiress . another instance is the ability to stick with it . it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet , offering too little story in too long of a movie .",0,1

"i was unsure whether or not andy sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit malibu express . with his film fit to kill he has proved that sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one shot director . the plot written by sidaris , which was ungratefully passed up by the academy , is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns . the main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as ksxy . cleverly , ksxy is actually their secret headquarters . in fit to kill they confront their long time nemesis kane , who is trying to steal one of russia's most prized diamonds . a well written screenplay is not all , excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic . panned by the critics and the box office , this film will be appreciated in years to come . it is now suffering the same fate as clockwork orange and taxi driver did , but in the future will undoubtly become recognized . i am disappointed no critic circles have recognized andy sidaris's trademark filmmaking . the costumes , the special effects , all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking . it may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself . my personal rating is 10 10 . the drama is as thick as the blockbuster runaway bride , and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece last action hero . andy , keep up the good work .",0,1

"there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned . one either likes it very much , applauding its sincerity , its liberal point of view and fine acting , or else loathes its obvious propaganda , mediocre dialogue , cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness . i fall very much in the latter category , and found the film and play , concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartime a crushing bore , worthwhile mostly for the acting , and even then only intermittently . that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant . her plays were written for people who shared her point of view , and she seldom explored ideas that weren't already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the other side is . even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say , as in rhine i still can't stand the way she says it . her characters are unreal , and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality . she really had nothing new to say . i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthy's long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago . for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days , i urge a peek at watch on the rhine , as bad in its way as angels in america , which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago .",0,1

"this film is one of the worst adaptations of pride and prejudice ever filmed and if jane austen were alive , she would demand that her name be removed from the film . austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between elizabeth bennet and fitzwilliam darcy . it is also a commentary on the class structure of regency britain . this film focuses only on the love story , thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel . there are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film . in the film , the dance at which darcy snubs elizabeth is not the refined dancing done by the gentry , to which the bennet , lucas , bingley , and darcy families belong , but is rather the dancing of the lower classes . the gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance . there are costume and hair problems , too . the custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear bonnets when outdoors . women of the regency period were not so liberated as to forego the bonnet requirements in public . the worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of elizabeth in her nightgown and coat and mr . darcy sans cravat and vest at which they admit their love for each other . this is an unforgivable liberty with the novel . no respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour . but the worst thing of all with this film is the mangling of austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue . austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he she can write like austen . the writer of the non austen dialogue not only lacks austen's talent but also has no feel for austen's style . the juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring . as for the acting , the best is done by judi dench , who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy . brenda blethyn takes some liberties in making mrs . bennet less awful than austen's portrayal . her portrayal is interesting and seems to work . donald sutherland is miscast . his affected british accent is terrible and he portrays mr . bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century . matthew macfadeyn's portrayal of darcy is flat . i can't imagine anyone falling in love with his mr . darcy . keira knightly is a pretty elizabeth , but her portrayal of elizabeth bennet is far too modern . knightly focuses on the elizabeth's forthrightness , but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time . she would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period . if one is making a period movie , one must be true to the period . this film needed an historical adviser who actually knows something about the regency period . it also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of austen's text . i can only hope emma thompson decides to do a film of pride and prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds . the best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the english countryside . chatsworth is well used as pemberly as it was in the 1995 bbc adaptation . but pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film . true fans of austen will rush home to watch their dvds of the far superior 1995 bbc production with jennifer ehle and colin firth or to read austen's text in order to wipe this version from their minds .",0,1
"my wife and i met doing a professional production of the merry widow in 1982 in english , but a straight translation . only the very basic skeleton of the original plot is visible in this adaptation . most of the characters have been deleted , along with the entire b plot , and all but one of the characters remaining have been renamed . most of the characters in the movie aren't in the operetta , either . the action has been moved from paris to , at first , washington , dc , and then to the fictional country of pontevedro , which the movie has renamed marshovia , and only later to paris . the net result is that we don't reach the beginning of the original play until about 45 minutes in . and the main source of tension in the plot is deleted , too . in the original , years before , count danilo and the heroine were very much in love , but his family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor ; it's his broken heart that has rendered him a careless playboy . now that , as a widow , she's the richest woman in the world , she still loves him , and he still loves her , but his pride won't let him admit it to anyone , even himself , and she must spend three acts playing mind games to break him down . the trope of the aristocrat with money problems who won't admit that he's in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think supplied the main plots of a substantial fraction of viennese operettas for decades after the 1906 widow . in this movie , they've never met before , which rips out not only the heart of the whole thing , but nearly all the comedy . lamas does a pretty decent job , though . an interesting musical point is that several times we hear a snippet or so of tr s parisien , an extra song written in english , despite the title for the london premi re , which was not , as far as i know , usually found in american productions until the 1980s or so .",0,1

"i was fairly lost throughout most of this film , and i am the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema greats as david lynch twin peaks fire walk with me and darren aronofsky pi . not to say that northfork doesn't make sense on some level , it just doesn't combine to form a wholly coherent film . as time passes from watching the film , its themes and intentions become clearer , but during my initial viewing , i was really confounded , and i find that this is the major fault of the film . its lack of direction . the plot centers on the town of northfork , montana in the year 1955 . the town has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydro electric dam . the major problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated . a group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned , and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and townspeople . simultaneously , the film tells the story of irwin , a very sick young boy or is he a fallen angel ? whose adopted parents gave him back , due to his illness , to the northfork orphanage that they adopted him from . father harlan nick nolte cares for the dying irwin , but irwin imagines or does he ? ! that a group of angels including daryl hannah and anthony edwards have arrived in the desolate and empty town looking for a fallen angel . irwin has scars on his back and on his head , and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where the humans amputated his wings and halo . oh yeah , and during all of this there is a strangely surreal walking animal on stilts that roams throughout the backdrop of the landscape . there are a lot of other small events that happen in the film , but none of them end up amounting to much more than momentary intrigue . one can appreciate the artistic quality of the film it's obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film and its rich cinematography , but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement . like i wrote earlier , it becomes clearer , long after viewing , what has possibly taken place in the film . irwin is dying , and so is northfork , and in coping with his own loss and death , irwin has most likely created characters , from ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the orphanage , to console him as he is abandoned and his life nears its end . but then again , maybe he really is an angel , and he has found his kind and can now return home . i must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film , heartbreaking , vivid and full of loneliness and sadness . unfortunately , the film as a whole just ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete .",0,1
"let freedom ring was probably made with the best of intentions , but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final product . the folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers , working on the railroad being financed by robber baron edward arnold . there are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroad's path and these folks are dealt with summarily by arnold's hired men . one man who won't give in is lionel barrymore whose son is coming home from harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the rancher's cause . only nelson eddy decides the best way to fight is to go zorro on the bad guys . but other than charles butterworth no one knows he's the wasp a very interesting choice of names by the way . what arnold's done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east , getting the immigrants to vote . nelson's idea is simple , if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy arnold is , they'll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst . he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed . the railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants , not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it . it's a real united nations working on arnold's railroad . the workers are kept in line by foreman victor mclaglen and nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like john wayne did in the quiet man . of all the films that starred jeanette and nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo , this was the worst of what they did at mgm . nelson is about to be hanged along with barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best , but certainly nothing worth being hung for . and virginia bruce who plays the nelson's girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of my country tis of thee that the immigrants join in with . in the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters , arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere else . i kid you not , that's the ending here . just what is the message , vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with arnold ? but somehow you'll get by here ? i do wonder some times if 20 years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities , that the good citizens of that town haven't rethought about what nelson eddy did . if they did they're probably running him out on a rail . nelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by sigmund romberg , where else but here . the song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country . too bad it didn't have a better venue . the almost platinum blonde virginia bruce i'm sure is dubbed here . and i'm sure jeanette macdonald was just as happy she wasn't accompanying nelson on this trip west .",0,1

"i know that full moon , or any other film studio for that matter , could never recapture the fun and cheesy scifi feeling that was the original trancers . ' and with the last two entries in the series having jack deth in medieval times instead of futuristic los angeles , it became quite obvious that there really was little hope in reviving the trancers series . breathing new life into a film is one thing , but taking our main character out of his element and putting him into the past , well , it didn't work ! so now with trancers 6 , full moon has breathed so much new life into the series that we don't even deal with jack deth any more . we now deal with his daughter , jo . jack is in her body and must go into the past and fight the trancers one more time . br br minor spoiler first scene of the film revealedbr br to prove how bad this movie is , you only need watch the first two minutes of the film when the original jack deth appears on the screen . but it's not actually tim thomerson . it's clips of him and sound bytes strung together trust me , you can tell they're strung together horribly to provide the viewer the last of the true jack deth humor . and from this point on , things only go down hill . having this girl , jo deth , as our main character while jack deth is supposed to be in her body , is the worst idea in the world . having this cute young woman act as a rough and tough man isn't the right track at all ! it doesn't work and it really comes off as foolish . br br i'm not going to go into the aspects of special effects and makeup because most reading this know what full moon has become a really , really , low budget enterprise . i don't know what to say about this movie , except i really wish full moon could be like it was in the days of demonic toys , puppet master , and trancers 1 . back then , while the special effects weren't great , the story telling was . they made serious bmovies for serious b movie and horror fans , and that just doesn't take place today with the new full moon studios . i yearn for the good ol' days , and truly hope , that full moon can pull itself out of this horrible slump that they're in right now . br br trancers 6 gets a 2 out of 10 .",0,1
"writer director robert downey , sr . , a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s , satirized the new york madison avenue advertising world with his avantgarde comedy putney swope . downey doesn't confine his ridicule to advertising , but tackles black militant culture , the dynamics in hollywood's portrayal of race , the elite white power structure , and character of corruption in any power struggle . as audacious and ambitious as putney swope strives to be , it qualifies as a terrible film , amateurishly made on a shoestring budget with a noname cast and humor that lacks hilarity . everything about this movie reeks with improvisation . putney swope stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture . like most marx brothers movies , the plot is thin , providing an excuse for downey's anecdotal gags , most of which are terrible . br br the chairman of a prestigious madison avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting . before the body has been removed , the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him . each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself . sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member , putney swope arnold johnson , since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him . swope pink slips all but one of the white executives , surrounds himself with black , pistol packing employees , and renames the firm truth and soul advertising . swope decides to alter the face of american advertising . he refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol , tobacco , or war toys . swope's clients stage an exodus after he becomes the ceo , and grandstanding attracts a new lineup of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from swope's militant employees . swope exploits his africanamerican staff , too , ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns , all of which are hailed as a 'new wave' of marketing genius . incredibly , swope's conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue swope's advertising tactics constitute a threat to the national security . the high point of this black white , 85minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color . unfortunately , downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome . the funniest part of putney swope involves our eponymous protagonist's dealings with u . s . president mimeo in washington d . c . pepi hermine , a marihuanatoking midget with a kissingerlike teutonic adviser larry wolf spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car , the borman 6 .",0,1
"ok , let me again admit that i haven't seen any other merchant ivory the distributor films . nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director , so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated . with that admittance , let me begin . br br before the rains is a different kind of movie that doesn't know which genre it wants to be . at first , it pretends to be a romance . in most romances , the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character , is separated from the supporting character , and is sometimes united with his or her partner . this movie's hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her . his name is henry moores and her name is sajani , and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj british imperial rule . henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid , despite his legal marriage and child overseas . what could be better than that ? they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them . word spreads to sajani's husband who questions her involvement with moores . she denies any contact with him , but moores asks her to leave the area . sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide . please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film . the film changes tone and becomes a crimedrama in its final portions . br br sajani's body is discovered right as moores' family comes to visit . the alleged perpetrator is moores's englisheducated assistant t . k . t . k . knows of his master's affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened . once he is declared innocent , he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores . t . k . is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall . br br i want to warn you , this isn't a romance film . the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting . this image is captured directly from the film's opening , but quickly disappears . then it's over . it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love . it isn't effective , at all . not only is the movie not a romance , but its characters lack any personality . they are bundles of walking clichs . moores is an arrogant white man who doesn't recognize his indian friend , t . k . 's intelligence . t . k . is torn between his own heritage and his educative background . sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life . oh , and , of course , moores' family is inquisitive into sajani's death but still slightly racist to indians . if the tone wasn't so serious , i would be willing to overlook these problems , but it isn't . the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development . br br no , this film isn't terrible . other than the laughable screenplay , it isn't poor . the actors are all experienced and perform well here . nandita das , who plays sajani , was part of wonderful indian drama water . even director sivan has an impressive resume . he recently oversaw the terrorist , which is part of roger ebert's great movies collection . what happened here ? why is this movie so bad ? well , sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs . apparently , the story was timeless , and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930's india . i don't have any problem with that approach , but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time . the actors , cinematography , and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivan's aura , you'll probably not enjoy it . my recommendation is that you presume you aren't in accordance with him and watch something else . final consensus and out of",0,1

"using tons of stock footage , not only from trader horn but also the first two films in the series for example the alligator fight was used last time out this is one of the weakest films in the mgm series . its a huge let down after the classic tarzan and his mate which is possibly the best film in the series . br br the plot has jane's cousins coming into the jungle to tell her that she has inherited a fortune if she'll come back to claim it . they are kind of in the bind since the relative that left her the money cut them out of the will . hiring a great white hunter , who secretly wishes to capture tarzan and sell him , the pair heads into the jungle where they run into the usual jungle troubles more so because of the stock footage . after lots of talk jane decides to go back to civilization and we get long sequences of tarzan and jame making kissy face . finally into the last half hour the plot to capture tarzan is put in motion and things at last become interesting as plans go awry and things look very grim for all concerned . . br br painfully dull film is clear evidence of a troubled production . the film seems to have been assembled from several different films with the first half hour playing as an almost exact repeats of the previous film . the middle third shows signs of having to stretch things out and having plot lines that ultimately went nowhere . the last third where tarzan is captured and the party is put into peril is the point that the film finally comes to life it also shows signs of the graphic violence that caused much of the need to reshoot the film . to me its a great wonder how the series managed to continue on from here since this film isn't very good except at the end . i would be hard pressed to explain it except i would have to say that it was the relationship between weissmuller and o'sullivan as tarzan and jane which kept people coming back . its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples . br br i should probably also mention that this is the point that the film became less real and more fantastical with the appearance of the tarzan tree house . i really dislike the first hour or so of this film a great deal and find it a great waste of time and energy . if you can come in towards the end i would recommend giving the film a try . otherwise i would just skip the whole film and move on to the next film in the series .",0,1

"so on the chills network on cable they are having vampire month , i'm such a dork , but i love vampires . so after a few duds that they showed i was pretty disappointed , but then i noticed sleepwalkers was written by stephen king . so i decided to go ahead and check it out , well much to my surprise , this movie was really bad . most stephen king films are entertaining and some are very scary . while sleepwalkers was bad , it was a beautiful kind of bad . i had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was . i've never read sleepwalkers , from what i understand this is the only real vampire story by king , so i can't really compare book to film . i don't know if it was just my tv , but sleepwalkers looked like it was made for tv . the special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched , even if it is fantasy , it had a lot of problems . br br charles brady and his mother mary are vampires who feed off the life force of virgin women . they are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both telekinesis and illusion . their one weakness is cats , who are not only able to see through their illusions but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them . they also maintain an incestuous relationship . charles and mary have taken up residence in a small indiana town . charles attends the local high school , and there he meets tanya robertson in his creative writing class . tanya does not suspect the real reason why charles wants her so much ; to take her life force for his mother , who is starving . at first , it seems that charles has fallen in love with tanya . on their first date , however , a picnic at the nearby cemetery , charles attempts to drain the life force from tanya while kissing her . as it happens , deputy sheriff andy simpson who had earlier tried to pull charles over for speeding , drives by the cemetery and notices charles' car . when tanya runs to him for help , charles tracks andy down and kills him . when charles then turns to resume his life forcedepleting make out session with tanya , the deputy's cat , clovis , rises to the occasion and nearly kills charles by scratching him in the face and chest . mortally wounded by clovis , charles staggers back home to mary . mary then seeks vengeance on tanya's family . br br so to sum this movie up basically you should expect the cheese to overflow . the scene where charles attacks tanya for the first time is very clich and you almost vote for charles to win just because tanya is one of the dumbest female leads in horror movies . then you gotta love the scene where mary has a gun and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explodes , god bless hollywood explosions and exaggerations . i'm taking the movie for what it is , it's just so deliciously bad that it turns into a dark comedy for me that i could just enjoy making fun of . i'm not sure if this is what stephen king wanted to see for his story , but he does have his typical cameo in the film . so my suggestion if you watch this movie , just take it for what it is and don't over think it , it's mindless entertainment with corny effects , bad casting , a silly story and enough cats to make the crazy cat lady from the simpson's say wow , that's a lot of cats . br br 410",0,1
"for those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline , this one is for you ! from the bleak new york city atmosphere , which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place , to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality , this movie is a real downer . br br why it won the academy award was because it was so shocking at that time that hollywood , brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned , wanted to celebrate that fact . filmmakers then were like an immature sixyearold with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store . so , hollywood gave theater viewers for probably the first time a dose of rape , prostitution , homosexuality , child nudity , homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing . . . . and then awarded its work . br br it also hoped , i'm sure , to shock mainstream audiences . well , it succeeded on that level . audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the academy , proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time , couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage . br br forty years ago , as a very young man , i found this film fascinating , too . however , seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth i never watched to view it again . br br the acting was good , but so what ? acting is good in many films . nobody ever said dustin hoffman and jon voight couldn't act . hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wackedout people . he was kind of like the johnny depp of his era , playing guys like ratso rizzo in this film and then going to be the rain man later on . yes , ratso is a character you'll never forget , and joe buck voight is one you want to forget , but the story is so sordid , it overwhelms the fine acting . br br this movie isn't art , and it isn't worthy of its many awards ; it only pushed the envelope bigtime in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics . it's two hours of profanity and ultrasleazy , religious cheap shots , glorifying weirdos andy warhol even gets in the act no surprise , and generally despicable people . br br i did like the catchy song , everybody's talking' that helped make harry nilsson famous , but even that was bogus because fred neil wrote the song and sang it better , before nilsson did it . . . . and few people have ever heard of neil which is their loss . and as mentioned the name ratso rizzo kind of stays with you ! br br the film is a landmark , but in a negative sense , i fear this marked it as official that hollywood had gone down the toilet , and it has remained in the sewer ever since .",0,1

"it is not obvious from viewing this film so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it but this presentation on the realities of islam , and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all nonmuslims is lacking objectiveness , and also completely fails to factor in the human condition . it is one thing to document that the koran says many things about how a devout muslim is required to interact with nonmuslims , but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of islam , will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system . there is reason to call much about the presenters into question , such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism ; don't swallow it all , hook , line , and sinker , without some thinking of your own . br br one specific , for instance , is researching the person walid shoebat ; who claims to be a former muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in bethlehem . there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions . i am not nor have i ever been a muslim . i have never read the koran . i am not a christian , nor a member of any faith . but i am an intelligent and discerning human . while the film is quite disturbing , in its presentation of how some muslims view their obligation to islam ; i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the fundamentalists . just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical christians , so , too , there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among jews and muslims . br br when you watch this film , you need to have the salt shaker on hand . one grain will not be enough , you'll need more . please use your own mind and think for yourself , research what is presented , and evaluate the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video . there is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together , indicating a definite bias . be your own brain .",0,1

"life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers . such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for ; but to be effective they must also be entertaining . unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read ; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round . the first such work to become really widely known was probably george orwell's 1984 first published in 1948 , and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film . br br watch or read it and then , when you are feeling a little depressed by man's inhumanity to man , reach for cinderella 2000 . this is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing ; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period . most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments . to exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a dvd or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption . there are many worse films appearing as dvd's these days , and frankly i do not care much what happens either way . br br so far the best of the films of this genre has probably been the handmaiden's tale , but i would very happily swap them all for a well made film of jack london's towering novel the iron heel . ambitious as this would be , it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it imdb only lists a bw silent version made in russia in 1919 .",0,1

"it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camerawork and busy but scratchy background score that accompanies this 1933 release . although sound came into general use in 1928 , there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman , unhappily married , who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods . br br the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town , proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover . in a frenzy of jealousy , he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment , losing his nerve . it's probably the most tensionfilled scene in the otherwise decidedly slowmoving and obviously contrived story . br br hedy lamarr is given the sort of closeup treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer , but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood . her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love aribert mog , the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim . br br the swimming scene is very brief , discreetly photographed , and not worth all the heat it apparently generated . the lovemaking scene , later on , is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the filmartfully so . more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolismand this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece . br br not so . it's disappointing , primitively crude in its sound portions including the laborious symphonic music in the background and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b . mayer saw the film and on the basis of it , gave her a career in hollywood . he must have seen something in her work that i didn't . br br it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work . the jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed . it fails to end the film on the proper note .",0,1

fontaine do their one dance number together in the film , prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate . fortunately , it's a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer . br br a foggy day in london town fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night , crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london . at times , he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog much like the musical number itself . br br nice work if you can get it a great song that is misused in the movie . during a social event at the manor house , fred gets drawn into a chorus of dourfaced singers who are haphazardly singing this song . each time fred joins in , the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave . again , harry groener did a better dance number with this song in crazy for you . drum dance number as fred and joan are eloping , fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums . as usual , it's a great dance number . but there's absolutely no need for it , except to prolong the movie . br br the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine . as he leaps from the balcony , he finds a convenientlyplaced trapeze that's right , a trapeze hanging from a nearby tree . fred or rather , a stuntman in fred's clothes grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it . br br the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone , but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote . the ff button allows you to skip through the other , boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers .",0,1

"superficically , brigadoon is a very promising entertainment package . gene kelly and vincente minnelli , the team behind an american in paris , are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations . gene's leading lady is cyd charisse , one of the best dancers of 40s50s cinema , and unlike the generally superior it's always fair weather this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances . lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as my fair lady and minnelli's musical masterpiece gigi ; lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent american in paris . br br what happened along the way ? why is the movie itself such a stupid bore ? minnelli himself didn't want to do the movie , despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner . maybe it was because the movie's innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli . but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits , minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting , if not liberating way . the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold . br br while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like cabin in the sky and meet me in st . louis , the plaidtights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those neverhavebeen locales . its whimsy doesn't even match up to the glossy luster of yolanda and the thief or the pirate because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions . the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellowtraveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him . the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect . for example , in exchange for brigadoon's immortality , the honorable and most generally good pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge . br br at one point we're assured that everybody's looking for their own brigadoon . suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren't looking for this kind of quasiqueasy paradise . the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing , but could work if the players were perfect . but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie , and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in yolanda and the thief . van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly even lighting 3 cigarettes at one point like levant in aip , and he provides a lot of amusing moments . but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossedoff van johnson performance .",0,1

"tonight's film course film was the legend of the suram fortress and during its 87 minute running time it managed to quickly jump into my top five most difficult films of all time . that's difficult to watch ; films so different to everything else that you're seeing something totally alien . a brief synopsis would be a group of georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from invaders , but every time they are about to put on the finishing touches , for no readily apparent reasons it collapses . so they go and see a fortune teller who advises them that if they want to get the fortress to stay standing , they need to find a youth , a tall blonde blue eyed boy to be buried into one of the walls during the construction and his presence will ensure that the construction job will be completed smoothly . and sure enough in those closing moments there he is gladly being smeared in cement and eggs , giggling as he's buried alive , with only his mother to grieve . br br it actually a fairly simple story . but the director , sergo paradjanov , working in soviet georgia in 1984 , not too long after leaving a fifteen year jail term , doesn't follow any of the film making rules we are used to . there are very few close ups . very often the action we need to be following is hidden in the bottom left hand corner of a landscape shot , extraordinarily easy to miss . there are very few close ups and at times its hard to tell whose doing what to whom and why . every now and then the film goes off on digressions which have no relevance to the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer . the music is utterly mad , with found sounds , on screen instruments and church organ dropped in seemingly at random . at times when nothing seems to be happening , someone will break into a jig , almost playing time until the next scene comes along . but infuriatingly there is an obvious cinematic voice behind it all so you're compelled to try and understand the message whatever it is . one of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you can't believe what you're seeing .",0,1

"there seems to be a spectrum of cinema . on the left , there are movies made mostly for entertainment andor commercial purposes . in the middle , there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic . on the right are movies that are not as commercial , but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product . br br i'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other , but that when a movie goes too far to either end , it's rarely good . such is the case with naqoyqatsi . br br i had no idea what to expect when i saw it advertised . a few friends were going and asked if i wanted to come along . none of us knew what to expect , and by the end , none of us were pleased . br br yes , there are breathtaking images . yes , i'm amazed at the lengths the filmmakers went to in searching through archival footage . yes , the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to , and probably the best part of the experience . the thing is , this goes so far to the right side of the spectrum i mentioned that i can't say anything nice about the movie as a whole . br br it's preachy . it's a jumble of symbolism and obvious morality . it's not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way . it's just telling us things we already know that is , if we can even figure out what it's saying . br br this movie is simply art for art's sake . an attempt to say look at how deep and thoughtprovoking we can be by using montage ! when a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than about its subject , it ceases to be a film and simply becomes celluloid selfgratification .",0,1

"watching truth about love is this a double entendre about the star ? is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep you put it in the dvd slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day . and it works for that for that purpose being a british romantic comedy it is a bit more . br br the story is a rather simple one about a wife alice jennifer love hewitt married to an increasingly distant husband sam jimi mistry who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice . his partner archie dougray scott is fond of both sam and alice , but has a longtime attraction to alice that goes beyond friendship . alice pals with her sister felicity kate miles , a free love advocate , who encourages alice to have affairs . on valentine's day , after a drinking binge with her sister , alice mails a card to sam signed 'anonymous' as a test to see if sam responds , testing his fidelity . at the same time archie mails a radish seed packet to alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not . both have ex post facto regrets . sam in fact is spending time with a lover katya branka katic and is indeed cheating on alice . alice arranges assignations with sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet sam in disguise as 'anonymous' to test his fidelity . the entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise of sorts of the fluffy script . br br british comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting . perhaps had director john hay elected to cast a british actress as alice instead of pasting a phony accent on jennifer love hewitt the result may have been improved . but in the end this story by peter bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages . one terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive . there are some nice scenes of london and a few moments of passable humor , but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background musicwhite noise . grady harp",0,1

"no one is going to mistake the squall for a good movie , but it sure is a memorable one . once you've taken in myrna loy's performance as nubi the hotblooded gypsy girl you're not likely to forget the experience . when this film was made the exotically beautiful miss loy was still being cast as foreign vixens , often asian and usually sinister . she's certainly an eyeful here . it appears that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled . in most scenes she's barefoot and wearing little more than a skirt and a loosefitting peasant blouse , while in one scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel . i suppose i'm focusing on miss loy's appearance because she is by far the best if not the only reason to tune in to this creaky antique and to keep watching . you sure won't be attracted by the dialogue , which is hopeless . in one typical passage , nubi gazes out the window at the departing caravan and waxes poetic always the gypsies , they sing . weird and sad . when the big sun have breath of fire that burn , and when the pale moon look from behind cloud and breathe air cold as death , they sing . poetic , or what ? lovers of purple prose will have a field day . i can't help but wonder , though , if in her later years miss loy preferred not to recall her involvement with this project . br br like so many early talkies this one was an adaptation of a recent broadway success . the stage version opened at the 48th street theatre in november of 1926 and ran for over a year . the play provoked a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic robert benchley , who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin english . according to a muchrepeated anecdote mr . benchley squirmed uncomfortably through the opening portion of this show . the spanish village setting moved to a village in hungary for the movie , for some reason gave the actors leeway to practice their accents with varying degrees of success , but benchley's patience reached its limit when , during a family dinner sequence , a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl dashed into the room shouting help ! help ! he keel me ! she then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and exclaimed me nubi ! me good girl ! me stay here ! at that point mr . benchley rose and announced to his companion me bobby . me bad boy . me go now , and left the theater . br br the film version offers numerous examples of unintended humor but never comes close to benchley's level of wit . the melodramatic plot concerns the lajos family father josef , mother maria , and son paul , a student at the nearby college . we would consider this prosperous family uppermiddle class as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life , but their comfortable existence is abruptly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by , yes , nubi the nubile gypsy girl . she arrives at their door during the storm of the title symbolizing stormy emotions , i daresay . the girl is fleeing an abusive relationship and begs for sanctuary . after considering the matter the lajos family agrees to hide her from her angry lover , who shows up shortly afterward but is turned away . nubi becomes a servant in the household . kindness motivates the family's decision to take her in , but soon enough that conniving little goodfornothing nubi has paid them back by seducing every ablebodied male in the vicinity , starting with the lajos' servant peter , then working her way up to son paul . nubi breaks up paul's relationship with his fianc irma played by loretta young , still a teenager , causes him to flunk out of school , and then prompts him to buy her jewelry by stealing the savings of the family's maid lena zasu pitts . lena , for her part , is still mourning the loss of her own fianc peter , seduced and tossed aside by nubi when she turned her attentions to paul . ultimately nubi sets her sights on the pater familias josef , and i suppose if the running time had been longer she also would've gone after uncle dani , maria , the village priest and god knows who else . br br i guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this one easily lends itself to parody , but during its first half the squall nonetheless exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap we watch , hypnotized , as the bad girl works her spell on the menfolk and wreaks havoc like an irresistible force of nature almost like a storm ! ahhaa , another metaphor ! . but as the plot machinations grind on the campy fun fades . during the later scenes nubi is deemphasized and the focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of the lajos family , and after awhile these people get to be a real drag . the son in particular behaves like an absolute heel , yet the parents never acknowledge this or face up to their own shortcomings ; everything , we're told , is the fault of nubi , that nogood tramp . br br the men of the cast are dull . aside from miss loy the only actress who can handle performing in talkies is zasu pitts , terrific as usual . the mother of the lajos household is played by alice joyce , a longtime silent star who was out of her element with speaking roles , and who retired soon after this . loretta young's fresh prettiness provides a nice contrast to nubi's dusky allure , but her line readings are so awkward it's kind of endearing . no , there's only one reason to watch this flick , and that's nubi herself . i can't think of another actress who could've played this silly role and managed to come off half as well . i'm not an objective observer , however . i have a desperate crush on myrna loy and will watch her in anything , even the squall .",0,1
"it is a frank zappa axiom that music journalism is people who can't write interviewing people who can't talk for people who can't read . if you ever needed proof that musicians can't talk , this is the film for you . repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices wow . thank you , idris muhammed . this film is pretentious but , while much of the pontificating from youssou n'dour and his gang of merry men and one token woman grates , the music saves the day . br br the main idea behind the film what i take to be the main idea , dredged out of the inarticulate commentary is interesting . to gather a group of musicians from america and europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery , back to their roots in the music of west africa , and a concert in the old slave fort of gore off the coast of senegal . we are treated to gospel , blues , jazz and variations of these , including some fantastic drumming both in new orleans and senegal . there's also a good deal of n'dour's own compositions . br br sadly , that's another weakness . it's never entirely clear what n'dour himself wants to achieve . to some degree , the film appears to be an exercise in selfpromotion on n'dour's part . he wants to play his own music , jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires . he's clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the curator of the gore museum . br br the clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places . for example , somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir , but n'dour and most of his mates are moslems a point made repeatedly throughout the film . the whole early sequence involving the black christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group the only black christians who can hold a tone ? turn up in dakar at the end of the film . to be fair , they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film . if the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel , why not also in the direction of latin america ? where are the black musical influences from the caribbean and brazil ? samba ? reggae ? then there's europe . here the black diaspora doesn't seem to have produced any musicians of calibre , since n'dour chooses to draft in austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from luxemburg . are they in the team just because n'dour has played with him before ? what i personally found most irritating , though , was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnikblack powernation of islam cultural happening in the new york home of amir baraka a . k . a . leroi jones . hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history , and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance . why do so many africanamericans believe that taking an arabic name is an assertion of their african roots ? and why do they think arabic islam is so much more admirable than european christianity ? who do they think established the trade in african slaves in the first place ? the film doesn't have much to say about the situation in west africa today beyond the platitude that present conditions are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years . the senegalese appear to be a poor but happy , musical gifted folk , friendly and welcoming , respectful of their elders and not above fleecing the visiting americans in the fish market . is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination ? there is no comment on the armed guard that n'dour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of dakar . br br there is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from dakar came from dakar . the similarity between the folk drumming style of new orleans and the folk drumming style of senegal is cited in evidence . the last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland , bidding them farewell . except , of course , that by and large , the slaves shipped from dakar did not come from dakar . they were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever european power currently held the gore slave fort . the people of dakar are not the descendents of africans who escaped the slave trade , they are just as likely more likely to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile . br br the two agenda's clash again in the final part of the film . there are two separate endings . on the one hand , the concert which n'dour and co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the gore slave fort . the other end comes when the harmony harmoneers sing the spiritual return to glory , in the seaward doorway of the slave fort . this is deeply moving , even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears . br br this is a film that is flawed . unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions . irritating , confusing , beautiful and emotional by turns . watch it listen to it for the music and the feeling , but don't expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour .",0,1

"director kinji fukasaku is perhaps best known , in his homeland at least , for his japanese gangster films , a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics . violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both shogun's samurai and battles without honor and humanity , and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals . both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die , and since so little is done to develop them , their deaths have little impact when they do come . this film has other flaws as well . the makeup , costumes and sound design are distractingly poor , and the battle scenes were substandard as well , inferior to other samurai films of earlier years seven samurai comes to mind . br br sonny chiba plays the sonny chiba character in shogun's samurai , the nononsense master swordsman who strides through the film , scowling menacingly . what a guy ; he even gets to wear an eye patch . if you were expecting to see the legendary toshiro mifune , you may be disappointed ; his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo , and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting , he disappears for good . br br overall , the strengths of the film are its story , which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films , and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil . two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father , who may have had some help on his way out . early on , it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn't be more clearly good and evil ; after all , the older brother stammers and has a birthmark , the sure sign of a villain . eventually , however , it becomes clear that in a winnertakesall struggle for power , there are no heroes and villains , only winners and losers .",0,1
"formulaic to the max . neither title reflects the serial's actual content , fighting nazis in morocco , actually , the iverson ranch . the plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights . the packaging claims over 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters . that's at least three a chapter ! aside from seeing duncan renaldo cast as a spanish accented frenchman , watching how much furniture is overturned , smashed , thrown , burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about . when the protagonists start fighting , you can bet that everything in the room will be in it , too . so , kudos to the fight choreographer , who is the real star of this serial ! br br two positive notes the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights , and best of all , we have the girl side kick often a journalist , as she is here actually participating in the mayhem , mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys . yet to come is linda stirling killing the main villain in manhunt of mystery island 1945 . on the negative side , there are just too many jump out of the way escapes before the slab falls , before the car goes over the cliff , before the speedboat explodes , before the building explodes , before the truck hits you , etc . etc . br br it is claimed that this serial partially 'inspired' george lucas to make the first indiana jones film , but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial's development . br br rod cameron 'shines' as a moving rock , a role he played in all his films . other than watching all the furniture getting smashed , there's nothing really going on here , compared to other serials that have fewer fights , more story , better actors and more developed characters . br br i give it a 3 for all the furniture smashing .",0,1

"i enjoyed the first reviewer's comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a secondrun theatre in the early '80's . i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings . but to me , the cast was largely squandered , their personalities muffled by the masks , while the direction i think of as being unusually static , and the photography murky . the rating jotted down at the time was a nought , which means not worth sitting through even once . br br still , i too would jump at a chance to have a second look .",0,1
"one your screen will be filled with beautiful effects and colours . these do nothing for the story , but they will keep your lazy eyes occupied for some 50 minutes . a good example is the eternal use of a computer screen that shows each fingerprint from the database as that print is compared with the one they want to find out about . yeah , right . br br two these guys being like real professional pros , they will engage each other in intriguing pro talk look , grissom , these are what we call fingerprints . everybody has them , and they are different on each person . so , with these fingerprints we can actually find . . . . br br yup ! exactly like real pros would talk to each other if there wasn't a completely uninformed and stupid audience around . br br however , not everything about this show is bad . some stories work to some degree , and the colours are really beautiful . they use red , blue , green , yellow . . . all of them colours i've loved since kindergarten .",0,1

"the movie gets a score of 3 because it dared to be so very different . it features a cast acting while you can hear their thoughts and desires ! this is truly a weird film and an experience i won't forget . the only problem is that the experiment , though in some ways interesting , is generally quite dull and unengaging . in fact , it's amazing that a norma shearer and clark gable film could be this dull ! the film is based on a eugene o'neill play and it really does seem quite stagy . in fact , it would have been best just to keep it as a stage productionit just didn't translate at all to the big screen . br br so this movie is only recommended to diehard cinemaniacs and those who love gable films so much they just have to see all his films !",0,1
"sean bean is great , as are the photography , locations and costumes . however , the plot is somewhat muddled , and the conclusion flat . the plot has been substantially altered from cornwell's novel , and not to the better . unfortunately , this adventure is much better read than watched . sharpe was too narrowly drawn here , in contrast with his literary alter ego , who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks . i really enjoyed the brief scene in which sharpe is tripped by a real officer , and after a quick pause and piercing stare , pushes the surprised and cowed officer right back . it sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer . br br rating 4 of 10 .",0,1
"this series doesn't present the british view of the revolutionary war , so much as an antiamerican view of it . the underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of colonists enjoyed british rule ; that the founding fathers were manipulative schemers whose only goal was to draw britain into a violent civil war ; that the american supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist , violent louts , duped into the struggle . clearly , the intent of the author , richard holmes , is for the viewer to extrapolate these characteristics , in a straight line , from the american population of 1775 to today . br br for example , in the episode the shot heard around the world holmes dredges up an obscure print of the boston massacre , in which he claims the skin of crispus attucks , a black man and the first man killed in the revolution , was purposely whited out . holmes claims that portraying attucks as a black man would have been bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause . holmes never reveals how he knows this . and there's more . holmes goes to some length to work in a single , unsubstantiated , atrocity the desecration of the body of a british soldier . he compares the american militia to the viet cong and the mujahadeen without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups . the list goes on . br br supposedly , this series was made in response to mel gibson's the patriot . it says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to mel gibson on any topic . instead of presenting the british view , it seems holmes really wanted to give a sensationalistic , antiamerican view , and , in the process , he's made himself the roger corman of historians strictly thirdrate schlock .",0,1

"i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently . in my opinion , the film started out decent enough , but eventually got sour . br br the story a u . s . soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the u . s . has sent out to troops for christmas . he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life , a motivation to continue on . when he is given leave , he goes to the very town that the woman lives in . he comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card . he meets the family and after saving her dad a vietnam war veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street , the family decides to take him in for a while . we learn that he doesn't have a family back home . the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their logging company . the family comes to love him and viceversa . the soldier also becomes in love with the family's daughter the woman that sent the christmas card . there's only one problem . she already has a serious relationship with a man that she's in love with . it's also a long distance relationship . the boyfriend is very different from the soldier . he prefers wine and trips to france over hard labor and the great outdoors . the woman prefers the latter . throughout the rest of the film , there is a love triangle as the woman's boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season . everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what's best for her daughter . spoiler alert the woman comes to like the soldier more and more , as they have a lot in common . they happen to spend a lot of time together . she gradually becomes attracted to his persona . then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back . now she's so confused ! she's in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday , but she's become so fond of the soldier . soon enough , the boyfriend who doesn't know about the kiss , but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to propose to the woman and she accepts . his plans for their marriage , however , are not plans that she wants . she wants to be at home , have kids and be close to her family . he wants to travel the world , go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along . this doesn't sound too thrilling for the woman . however , the soldier feels bad about what he's done and doesn't want to make things worse . so , he decides to leave town , despite the dad's urging him to stay and be with his daughter . it all comes to a head when , at the christmas eve service with church , we find out that the soldier hasn't left yet . the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he , brokenhearted , basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her . the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together . br br things i like i like the soldier throughout much of the film . he's basically nice and polite , with a strong sense of doing good for others ; there are moments in which the family is going with church and participating in charitable causes ; the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table ; the dad and mom have a longlasting and evidently healthy marriage ; the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong br br things i don't like there is a very typical love triangle story in this film ; the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend ; most of the family practically applauds this behavior the family goes with church and participates in services , yet this is how they act ; there is some bad language br br conclusion i became disappointed as the film ran on , and it got worse and worse . i ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because i had enough . so , the film started out decent with some few gem moments , but ended up ruining itself . therefore , i don't recommend this film to anyone .",0,1

"too much of something borrowed grade bbr br super bowl sunday is one of the slowest days at movie theaters every year . because of this , movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend . every few years a studio releases a counterprogramming female skewing movie 2001's the wedding planner to compete with the big game . this super bowl weekend similarly titled the wedding date will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game . br br sick of people feeling sorry for her , singlewoman , kat ellis debra messing , tv's will and grace hires male escort nick dermot mulrony , about schmidt to pose as her boyfriend for her sister's wedding in london . her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married , and her ex fianc of seven years , who dumped her without a reason , is the best man . to make him jealous kat parades nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing . but ultimately nick helps kat realize that she can open up , and let someone love her . br br the film borrows too much from similar wedding movies . it is almost a carbon copy of 1999's picture perfect and mixes in scenes similar to the wedding planner and my best friends wedding . the movie also has a reverse pretty women theme going for it , and knowing her audience , the director makes clever references to that and other films . br br the wedding date has all the clichd elements of a typical wedding movie , there is the stereotypical overbearing mother holland taylor , legally blonde , and practically plagiarized wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner . the twist at the ending has been done before , but it was something that wasn't completely expected . the real reason why kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour . br br even though the wedding date is predictable , it is able to stand on its own . debra messing , in her first lead role , proves she can be charming and funny . dermot mulrony has great chemistry with debra messing , but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic . he is able to make best of what he is given , and be able to salvage the character . br br by the use of many clever puns often sexual , the film is actually funny . although primarily a chickflick the film has components everyone can enjoy . the feel good story , and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time .",0,1

"scooby doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple , successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world . so , what happens when you've been everywhere and done everything with the formula ? you switch it up right ? wrong . you stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again , keeping the core of its success intact . that is to say , stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it . this to me is why what's new scooby doo worked , they want back to the classic scooby doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in a pup named scooby doo but for the most part had not been tapped since the original scooby doo where are you . br br the first sign to me of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters ; there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think scooby doo you aren't thinking of filmflam , scrappy doo or scooby dum . even worse , the exclusion of the other core members of mystery inc generally indicate a group of production people who don't understand from a kids point of view how the show works . the basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual , stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand . br br this next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want i hope that i can explain why i think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole ; fred represents the driver , i think in general it is the purpose of fred to give the group direction , organization and subtasks . fred isn't a happygolucky teenager , he's your boss , your teacher , your dad , your authority figure . fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks problem always equals solution for fred . in many ways fred is the antithesis to shaggy . shaggy is your best friend , that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are , he enables you to be brave , to not be at the back of the pack . shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear . velma represents rational thought , she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show . left on her own would velma solve a mystery ? the group often finds itself in situations where truths aren't obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task , chance is represented by daphne . at one point i think it is the first scooby doo series she was known as danger prone . writers have used daphne to link unrelated events together through accident . she frequently is the one who finds the secret door , collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together . finally scooby himself represents us , the participant . he is always in the centre of events , capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of , yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate . scooby doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining . br br maybe i'm over thinking things but , in my life i've seen a lot of scooby doo being a 30 year old selfproclaimed nerd , it kind of rolls with the territory . to me there is a magic with the classic scooby doo formula that should never be messed with . br br as many have pointed out ; scooby doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite , it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal . messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else , something lesser .",0,1

"garden state is another of these indietype pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real truetolife human drama . oddly enough , the production is very good , so are the performances by some fairly bigname actors as well . where the picture is lacking is in zach braff's script , which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies . br br when you're as young as braff is , you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder . braff's experience looks to be from watching movies , then repeating the same trite clichs in his own movie . in garden state , he plays andrew largeman , a semisuccessful hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in new jersey to bury his mother , who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years . he appears to have no feeling about any of this ; he has no relationship with his father , who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a freak accident as a sixyearold , and has no particular despondency over losing his mother in fact , he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his , who works as a cemetery gravedigger . it all smacks heavily of beautiful girls , also about a guy who returns to his hometown to find himself and hang with his old friends , with a little ordinary people thrown in on the side . br br it's really a miracle braff could accomplish anything at all in his life , given his father and his useless friends i'm surprised he didn't kill himself , who are still living their lives as though they're still in high school , partying with dumb bimbos , drinking and drugging , etc . none of them even recognize him from his tv role as the retarded quarterback natalie portman's character , the most aware person in the movie , does , and say things , like hey , i remember you from junior year . these guys are such losers , for them , watching television would be a cultural leap forward . even one friend , who made millions inventing a silent velcro , has no real reason to live , because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying . and you don't need big money to party like a high school sophomore . br br braff , it is revealed , is heavily medicated , which keeps from feeling and dealing with anything , really , like an adult would . then he meets sam natalie portman a sortof lost girl , who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10yearold in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size . anyway , they fall in love , and braff learns to feel again . the clichs come fast and furious . braff has a long delayed hearttoheart talk with his cold , distancing father and tells him what it is and the name of the game . in one scene , braff and portman are in the millionaire kid's house , playing touchyfeely is front of a giant fireplace , and the bit is so routine , so standard movieschtick , i swear , i halfexpected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire . in another , braff visits a doctor ron liebman to get his junk refilled , and liebman tells him in easily the worst line in the movie the body can play tricks on you . i once found my exbestfriend's cufflinks in my wife's purse , and i didn't have an erection for a year and a half . obviously , no licensed physician would ever say that , but it's dirtbag poetry , a nod from braff to , i guess , his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of them , just as the 37 joke in clerks , was kevin smith's nod to his dirtbag buddies . br br anyway , braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope ; the story plays itself out predictably . but if you're going to have a movie that's walltowall clichs , at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it . and braff does . he has the right sort of vacancy , of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonkedout andrew both real and poignant , and natalie portman also of beautiful girls gives the movie a big lift . with her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood , she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion . jean smart is surprisingly good as portman's mother , and peter saarsgard though much better in shattered glass is notable as the gravedigger friend . i would recommend garden state if you can't get enough storybook romance out of movies , but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece , they're just clueless . braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot , write in a few fks and awesomes and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material . it doesn't .",0,1

"gung ho was a good idea , however it is to much to ask americans viewers to understand the dynamics of american jobs and foreign competition . in this movie the main character hunt stevensonmichael keaton goes to japan and convinces a japanese auto company to come to america and help his dying pennslyvania town . two things come at you . first why would a japanese company come to america to make cars when they do so , and so well at that ? secondly can anyone understand that american companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape american labor costs ? it makes the film's premise then that the number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its' top competitorsaside from germanyand put a plant there as unrealistic . keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time . but he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but director ron howard can't keep this from becoming a tv movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of japanese and american relations not withstanding . gung ho has a happy days and laverne and shirley feel to it as the producers of both tv shows made the film and then made the tv version of this movie as well which gives the film its' lightweight feel . the japanese manager gets to love his american workers and feels he and other japanese people can learnfrom americans . his no . 2 man saito who supposedly doesn't like americans all that much doesn't think so . i would have prefered all the japanese characters been like saito than the soft goofball characters they made the japanese out to be . it would have made the film more interesting .",0,1
"this vicious little film is horrendous . my low rating for it comes for two main reasons . the first is that it is an animal snuff film and i find that whole concept so vile it turns my stomach . filmed over a hundred years ago , i can only hope that we've evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate . this film is complete and utter exploitation , made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject . historical interest aside , this is something to watch only if one finds themselves in the grip of morbid fascination . br br reason number two ? look at the way that the camera is set up . it is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the full effect long march forward of the elephant , perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate viewpoint of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses . sickening . br br thomas edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence aren't in doubt . nobody is perfect , but when you realize that this film provided a an opportunity for him to trump early cinematic competitors with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted and b he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of dc as opposed to ac , you can't help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little too dispassionate and cold . any number of peter cushing's mad scientists would be proud . the rest of us should be ashamed and revolted .",0,1
"this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short . br br the opening match was a waste of the legion of doom , but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a doubledq . otherwise , mr . perfect would have had to put in overtime . kerry von erich , the ic champ , was wasted here . and this was the third ppv in a row where perfect jobbed . remember , before that he never lost a match . br br the second match was very good , possibly the best of the night . ted dibiase and the undertaker were excellent , while the jim neidhart had one of his wwf highlights , pinning the honky tonk man . koko b . ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel remember the big bossman and yokozuna ? . this was a foreshadowing of bret hart's singles career , as he came back from twoonone and almost survived the match . he and dibiase put on a wrestling clinic , making us forget that the point of the match was dibiase's boring feud with dusty rhodes . br br even though the visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive and only the second since '87 to have four survivors , this match was not a squash . this was the longest match of the night , and jake did a repeat of his '88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated . i think he could have actually pulled off an upset . these days , the match would have ended the other way around . br br one of the shortest ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising . possibly the most underrated wrestler ever , tito santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night , putting on war paint and pinning boris zukhov , tanaka , and even the warlord in the final survival match . it was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly , then go right back to his mediocre career . sgt . slaughter also did well , getting rid of volkoff and the bushwhackers , but that just wasn't a surprise . tito was . br br i think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the end . br br this show was boring and the matches were too short . the undertaker's debut was cool , but tito santana is the reason i will remember this one .",0,1

"this movie moved much too slowly for my taste . the concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentallyretarded family member in a way that i have not previously seen onscreen . however , the execution of the concept was flawed . each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance , then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way . that is , each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie , which i found to be a form of emotional and social retardation . i suppose this has artistic merit , given the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way aboveaverage intelligence friends and family . the acting , however , was welldone without exception . i agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful . in summary , i think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography , but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described .",0,1
i have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written . the acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it . in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer . i am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit dead like me where she plays the role of daisy adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner . i remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader . i felt as though if anyone might make it from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique nordic blond allure . if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'godfather' or perhaps 'beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a lowbudget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying it's a start !,0,1

"i don't remember too much about this movie except that there was a distinctly gratuitous destruction of luminaires lamps . almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and wanton destruction of useful light fixtures , even if outfitted with cheesy , '70'sstyle , cylindrical shades to keep with the time setting of the story . on one occasion , raucous lamp destruction takes place in a domestic fight scene between the brothers in both the living and dining rooms of their mother's house , with fixtures in both rooms being taken out . yet , the most malicious destruction occurs moments later in a bookie's office and includes , but is not limited to , the toppling of a fixture with a ceramic horsehead base , which is consequently disintegrated , and the severe denting of a cylindrical shade as a guy falls back into it during another fisticuffs fight . later , that lamp is toppled as well when the guy is shot , incurring further damage to the plasticcoated shade . br br while this movie encourages a particularly wasteful attitude toward lamps , one should keep in mind that lamps , regardless of their cheap construction or gauche , topheavy appearance , are still valuable for the illumination that they provide . however , if you ever feel the need to vicariously smash a lamp , i would highly recommend this movie .",0,1

"this adaptation , like 1949's the heiress , is based on the henry james novel . the heiress , starring olivia de havilland , remains as a wellrespected piece of work , though less true to james' original story than this new remake , which retains james' original title . it is the story of a awkward , yet loving daughter leigh , devoted to her father finney after her mother dies during childbirth . the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever , and considers her , as well as all women , simpleminded . when a young man chaplin of good family and little fortune comes courting , the father is naturally suspicious , but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man , is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him . leigh is a controversial actress most either love her or hate her and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style , like she's acting through gritted teeth . she's not bad in this , and she handles her role relatively deftly it's just an awkward role for any actress , making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses . while the character garners a lot of sympathy , she's not particularly likable . the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin previously seen in the truth about cats and dogs plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune , or is really in love with her . maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the wellmeaning aunt . finney is marvelous , of course , as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience , but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves . but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune ? this is only one instance where washington square differs from the heiress . another instance is the ability to stick with it . it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet , offering too little story in too long of a movie .",0,1
this is defiantly a dvd rental movie . i'm a big fan of the cast members but the storyline never really grabbed me . don't expect oh brother where art thou in any way shape or form . funniest part in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens over in the argon . seems like they were trying to copy some of clooney's funny facial expressions from oh brother where art thou but you could kind of tell they were trying for that . john krasinski was the bright spot and was solid throughout . renee zellweger plays the part of a zealous reporter willing to do whatever for the story . overall it's a movie worth watching at home .,0,1

"yet another version of mother of all gangster flicksthe classic godfather and yet another case of overhype due to media circus . sarkar , the 13th hindi film of ram gopal varma as director is also the weakest in his underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellentsatya and company . the charisma , the magnetic persona of the two bachchans playing fatherson duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for . not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which varma should be applauded . however , the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film . reasonthe other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp . the villains represent the typical bollywood baddies . a character who attracts attention is elder son played by kaykay but again not able to hold due to halfbaked characterization . . the drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of closeshots , which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance . the haunting score amar mohile and the sound design kunal mehta , parikshit lalwani anup dev , together with dark , murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images camerawork by amit roy contributes to visuals so typical of ramu's style . but there is an overuse of music though fortunately no songs are there in the film . but can interest of today's intelligently growing audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong visuals ? i don't think so . surely , audience maangey more and here film fails to deliver . in any adaptation , in order to add a new dimension , the biggest prerequisite is the screenplay , which is sluggish here not being crisp at places , and therefore the pace slackens quite often . what finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable , very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements . top stunt director allan amin ghani is also not in his best form . some scenes which require a different treatment includes a minister is talking foul about sarkar and the son is overhearing ; a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on sarkar , sarkar jr . escapes from the clutches of his enemies , a son easily motivated to kill his own father , a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him , a police commissioner slapping sarkar jrall this requires a more realistic , hardhitting approach which is the backbone to create the required conflict . the dialogues are weak for eg . look at an amateurish line where a cm says to sarkar jr . wo jo police commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya . . the women folk take on sarkar's working is completely ignored . the uninterrupted negotiations about criminal activities while sarkar is with his family also look slightly out of place in fact , the film follows a graph quite similar to ramu's own productionab tak chhappan . in depicting the battle between good and evil , the other side of lifethe law , police , administration , politics is completely ignored . certainly , more is expected in content . here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare . dear ramu , agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank , you definitely need to take some drastic overhauling measures in your film production factory , before it is too late .",0,1

"last time i checked , the nazis didn't win the second world war not that you'd sodding notice . after all , the third reich was pretty big on issuing orders and demanding cold , robotic obedience from the populace , and that's pretty much what we're saddled with today . but the way the orders are delivered has changed . instead of being barked at in a german accent through a loudhailer , they're disguised as concerned expert advice and floated under your nose every time you switch on the tv or flip open a newspaper there's a continual background hum , a middleclass message of selfimprovement , whispered on the wind . br br you eat too much . you eat the wrong things . you drink . you smoke . you don't get enough exercise . you probably can't even beep properly . you'll die if you don't change your ways . your health will suffer . have you got no selfrespect ? look at you . you sicken me . i pity you . i hate you . we all hate you . god hates you . don't you get it ? it's so sad , what you're doing to yourself . it's just so bloody sad . that's the mantra . and it goes without saying that the people reciting it are routinely depicted as saints . last year , the media dropped to its knees to give jamie oliver a collective blow job over his school dinners series , in which he campaigned to get healthier food put on school menus . given the backslapping reaction , you'd be forgiven for thinking he'd personally rescued 5 , 000 children from the jaws of a slavering paedophile . br br anyway , the series was a huge success . in fact in telly terms there was only one real drawback it wasn't returnable . after all , when you've saved every child in the nation from certain death once , you can't really do it a second time . the only solution is to find a new threat , which brings us to ian wright's unfit kids wed , 9pm , c4 , a weekly issuetainment programme in which the former footballer and renowned enemy of grammar forces a bunch of overweight youngsters to take part in some extracurricular pe . br br it's essentially a carbon copy of the jamie oliver show , with more sweating and fewer shots of pupils mashing fresh basil with a pestle an uplifting fable in which wrighty shapes his gang of misfits into a lean , mean , exercising' machine combating apathy and lethargy , confronting lazy parents , and attempting to turn the whole thing into a nationwide issue that'll have range rover mums everywhere dampening their knickers with sheer sanctimony in between trips to the conran shop . oh isn't it simply terrible , what these blobsome plebes do to themselves ? not our josh you understand he eats nothing but organic spinach and attends lacrosse practise six hundred times a week . br br bet he does , the little sh1t yes , it is heartwarming to watch flabby , inconvenient kids transforming themselves with a bit of simple activity . . . but there's something about the underlying eatyourgreens message that really sticks in my craw , in case you hadn't guessed . br br what happened to the concept of choice , you beep so a bit of jogging might increase your life expectancy so what ? that just equates to a few more years in the nursing home whoopee do . and besides , i'd rather drop dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a bunch of smug toss ends trying to outhealth one another . br br in episode two , video games and the internet are singled out as villains in the war on flab they make kids too sedentary , you see . oddly enough , tv , which is equally sedentary , and unlike those two activities , actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy along with your physique , escapes without a rollicking . funny that . br br well listen here , channel 4 instead of forcing kids to eat bracken or do squatthrusts , how about teaching them to think more expansively , so they reject the sly , cajoling nature of programmes like this ? or would that be a campaign too far ?",0,1

"maybe i'm really getting old , but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely . surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman that's me , schultz ! . lordy , lordy what i would give to see the light ! firstly , that phil silvers manic energy , wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life , if you will . although it is possible that the series , first titled you'll never get rich 195559 could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt . bilko , it is very hard to picture any other actorcomedian in the business wearing those master sergeant's stripes . br br such a strong identification is inescapable , though not the same sort of careerwrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys , like clayton morethe lone ranger , george reeves the adventures of superman and charles nelson riley uncle croc's block . br br one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950's tv screen to the 1990's moviegoing public is our collective memory . without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals , and their numbers were surely considerable ; even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times . it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles ; or even light years apart . br br so as not to be thought of as a totally square , old grouch please let's consider some other points . br br right here today , the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007 , let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years , furthermore , i've enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko '96 costars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman . after all , it was the talents of guys like this and so many others , alumni of nbc ; s saturday night and second city tv that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing . but a bilko remake ; it just didn't click . br br perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy always liked 'em ! but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby , old guys like me . br br so , we've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately , what's next ? howse about somebody doing hal roach's world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday ames and tv's 1st cartoon series crusader rabbit ? remember where you heard it first ! poodle schnitz !",0,1

"you would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic . these three who also happen to be three favorites of mine , walk around in a daze , looking like they'd rather be any place , but there . br br the sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic . in these days of political correctness , a film about american pioneers and the travails of their westward migration is something not done now . it should have been better done back then . br br kirk douglas is a former united states senator who's heading a wagon train west to build a settlement in oregon's willamette valley . being he's an expolitician , he rates above the hoi ploi he's leading . the script calls for him to have not only a covered wagon , but a carriage to lead the train . br br you think that's ludicrous , you ought to see the whipping scene where douglas orders his black servant , played by roy glenn to whip him . i won't spoil it by saying what causes douglas to demand this of glenn , but trust me , it's bad . br br robert mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored . there was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between widmark and douglas , but mitchum just saunters through the film above it all . br br maybe the friction helped somewhat because the movie calls for douglas , a widower , to have an eye on mrs . widmark , played by lola albright . now she's the best looking thing in the movie . br br the film billing says introducing sally field . this was made in between her gidget and her flying nun days . she plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of mercy mcbee . we first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents wagon , legs akimbo and inviting . of course she gets taken up on her invitation . br br her character is something like what's found in every trailer park in america and then again what was a wagon train , but one large trailer park on the move . br br despite this film , sally field went on to a two oscar career . what that woman had to overcome . br br victor mclaglen's son andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess . shame on andrew mclaglen , he's certainly done better in his career . br br and so will you , unless you're a stargazer .",0,1

"korine's established himself , by now , as a talented and impressive imagemaker . the promotional posters for mister lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions though there's one in particular i've yet to see in promo material that of a blueclad nun teasing a dog with a stick , surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down . the opening images of this film , of michael jackson lookalike diego luna riding a small motorbike round a track , is strangely compelling and beautiful roy orbison's mister lonely plays on the soundtrack , and the images unfold in slowmotion . there's also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance , without music though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him , in the middle of a paris street ; korine splices in sound effects and jumpcuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character's dance routine . br br the first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant ; father umbrillo werner herzog is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over , and drop food into , impoverished areas nearby . in a scene that is both lighthearted and affecting , herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco . as the exchange develops , herzog draws out of the man a confession he has sinned , and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place . this scene , short and sweet , gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins the sinner is played by a nonactor who was on set when korine and co . were filming and his adulterous ways had given him , in real life , a lasting , overwhelming guilt . br br henceforth , the film is hitandmiss ; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous , muddled narrative . whereas gummo and julien donkeyboy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks , mister lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness . a few scenes were cut from the film , which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters , due to continuity errors in costume a result , no doubt , due to the absence of a shooting script and korine's tendency for improvisation . one deleted scene in particular in which 'charlie chaplin' denis lavant and 'madonna' melita morgan have sex would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film i won't spoil it , but it's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration , and , as it is , only halfsucceeds . br br the two strands of the narrative , unconnected literally , are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning ; one compliments the other and vice versa . it's something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation . but there's not enough of the herzog scenes to merit their place in the film , and so any connection between these two allegoricallyconnected threads is inevitably strained and the inclusion is , in retrospect , tedious . br br this is an ambitious step forward from julien donkeyboy that suffers mostly , at least in the lookalike segments , from having far too many characters for the film's running length , a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone as was originally planned . br br with many of the imagery's selfcontained beauty , and moments of real , genuine connection with the soundtrack , this feels like it'd be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition . as an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation , it'd lose none of its power indeed , for me , it would perhaps be more impressive . the loneliness attached to iconic performativity such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them is wellcaptured in images such as that wherein 'marilyn monroe' a gorgeous samantha morton seduces the camera with a seven year itch pose in the middle of a forest , or when 'sammy davis , jr . ' jason pennycooke settles , postdance rehearsal , with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible , tranquil lake . br br as it is , moments like these , and all those where the titles of randomlychosen michael jackson songs crawl across the scene , are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be . br br for those who see it , i lost all faith during the eggsinging scene , late on . you'll know which scene i mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb , as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which korine has previously been hailed .",0,1

"clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of charles bukowski's work . the autobiographical henry chinaski character in bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by mickey rourke in 1987's 'barfly' , also starring faye dunaway . anyone who has seen 'factotum' should certainly see 'barfly' to get a better look at how bukowski wrote his character . 'factotum' lacks the greasy seediness of bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero . the inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of chinaski's misadventures doesn't work for dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy bloodsoaked rourke . rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's misbehavior a placesetting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer . dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a strutting , handsome , relatively cleanlooking wannabe writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of chinaski's story . dunaway's sleazy heroine wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'erdowell henry . the women in 'factotum' can't hold a candle to dunaway's 'distressed goddess' and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in 'factotum' proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to bukowski's raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships . i was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in 'factotum' marisa tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact ripoff from 'barfly' . br br if you want to see the best bukowski stories on film , see 'barfly' and 'love is a dog from hell' which also goes by the title 'crazy love' .",0,1
"i was unsure whether or not andy sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit malibu express . with his film fit to kill he has proved that sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a oneshot director . the plot written by sidaris , which was ungratefully passed up by the academy , is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns . the main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as ksxy . cleverly , ksxy is actually their secret headquarters . in fit to kill they confront their longtime nemesis kane , who is trying to steal one of russia's most prized diamonds . a wellwritten screenplay is not all , excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic . panned by the critics and the box office , this film will be appreciated in years to come . it is now suffering the same fate as clockwork orange and taxi driver did , but in the future will undoubtly become recognized . i am disappointed no critic circles have recognized andy sidaris's trademark filmmaking . the costumes , the special effects , all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking . it may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself . my personal rating is 1010 . the drama is as thick as the blockbuster runaway bride , and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece last action hero . andy , keep up the good work .",0,1
"n . b . spoilers within . assigning an artistic director to an operatic production naturally and inevitably means you are going to get a piece of that director's mind . but directing a wagner opera is an especially tricky task , as he was perhaps the most explicit opera composer in terms of what things should look like and how they should unfold . hansjurgen syberberg loads this filming of parsifal , wagner's final masterpiece , with enough extraneous ideas to cause it to nearly burst at the seams . you get more than a piece of the director you get the whole fatted hog and then some . syberberg is to be admired for his penchant for tearing back the covers on the uglier aspects of german history . but does it work to meld that desire to a wagner opera already brimming with its own concepts ? br br the scenes with the knights of the holy grail in acts i and iii are especially laden with visual allegory and symbolism . these are drawn come from wagner's own time , from long before , and go well beyond . if you know what these things mean , they can enrich syberberg's vision for you but not necessarily enhance wagner's vision ; if you don't know what they mean , they're simply confusing , if not annoying . i won't bother uncoiling the plot of the opera here . suffice it to say it is a typical wagnerian synthesis of diverse elements , in this case a blending of the holy grail legend with the principles , practices , and pageantry of christianity . the theme of redemption plays the main role here , as in nearly every wagner opera . br br i personally had to sweat to get through syberberg's first act amidst my jarring acclimation , the music saved the day . but act ii picks up the pace . here we meet klingsor , the evil sorcerer , out to entrap the wandering innocent fool parsifal . the greatest seductress of them all , kundry , will be used to entice him to the dark side . after an initial dalliance with more symbols , these get stripped away , and the long , gorgeous , transformational duet between young fool and temptress really takes off . finally the film starts working a genuine magic , and it is chiefly due to syberberg's choosing to set things naturally and simply . suddenly the acting starts to work the expressive actress edith clever and the luscious soprano of yvonne minton team to create a wondrous kundry ; suddenly the music seems to come to life and make vivid the inner turmoil of the two characters . the camera work stays simple and quietly fluid . in other words , wagner is allowed to tell his story more on his own terms . and it works beautifully . for me it was the most engrossing part of the film . br br with the reentrance of the knights in part 2 of act iii , the weird extraneous symbolisms unfortunately creep back in . some other loony syberberg ideas using a huge wagner deathmask as a major setpiece causing the composer's protuberant proboscis to loom comically large ; dressing the act iii knights in all manner of costumes , wigs , and makeup what is the director saying ? that the knights are a bunch of buffoons ? that they express multiple or timeless layers of significance beyond their surface functions ? it's anybody's guess ; the insertion just after the incredibly touching baptism of kundry by parsifal of rearprojection footage of the conductor rehearsing , in modernday realism , his orchestra in the studio this completely snapped my dramatic thread , requiring a few minutes to regroup ; the complete avoidance of having any time pass between acts ii and iii when we meet the knight and narrator gurnemanz again , he should be an old , old man , and parsifal should reemerge as a worldweary but wiser middleaged man ; but certainly the most bizarre stroke is to split the parsifal character into malefemale components . some find this the most brilliant stroke . no doubt i can credit karin krick , who plays parsifal 2 , with acting of strength and dignity she also happens to be the best lipsyncher of the whole cast . but please . . . wagner's conception of parsifal is already so complex . his growth from a completely innocent boy who knows nothing of his past , to his breakthrough realization in act ii of what amfortas's eternal wound means and how it has become his own , to his return as the great redeemer of act iii this is the journey of a masterfully constructed character . the bisexual emphasis is just gimmicky and absurd . and what's with this nonsense about a homoerotic gurnemanz and parsifal ? ? can't we just accept a mentorapprentice relationship , which is marvelously reversed in act iii ? br br the monte carlo philharmonic under armin jordan plays with passion and beauty though the chorus is disappointing . but after watching this film i only wanted to whip out my soltiled recording highly recommended and get my wagnerian bearings straight again . the film experience for me ranged from bizarre to entertaining to infuriating . to syberberg's credit , he's created a visually arresting work , and he certainly offers a unique take on an important opera . but instead of sticking to parsifal , he seems to have wanted to bring in all things wagnerian the man , the life , the enormous influence . . . all of it in crude symbolic code . parsifal the opera is already full of weighty symbolism the grail , the spear , the holy sacraments , baptism , amfortas's everbleeding wound , klingsor's selfcastration , the kiss , kundry's curse , and on and on . this is not to mention the musical symbolism sounding constantly in the score , in the form of wagner's leitmotif system . parsifal itself is one huge symbol ! getting back to my firstparagraph question , syberberg's whole hog is all way too much for me . but if this project sounds like something to tickle your fancy , then go for it . i won't recommend just staying away from this ; you may find yourself heartily satisfied . or if you need something to crack your wagner barrier , try it . . . but please , please , don't stop here . parsifal is in a late , very ripe league of its own .",0,1

"one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria gambarelli ! i half wondered if blake edwards was naming the character played by elke sommer in a shot in the dark after this nowforgotten performer though the spelling of the sommer character's surname was actually gambrelli . i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing la cucaracha . that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances like that of ms . gambarelli that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy devine as a great bullfighter yeah , right ! and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume . only funny part of those two is when they crywith buster providing handkerchief to bullduring the sad part of la cucaracha . also lame was seeing ted healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking healy for other movie stars . healy himself didn't know zeppo had left the marx brothers since he puts four between the and marx ! speaking of a marx , it was interesting seeing harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head . also interesting was seeing ida lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the vanities last year at least when announcer pete smith identified her . oh , and smith himself wasn't funny with his wiseguy narration . other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are mgm contract players either ! so with all that said , la fiesta de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy garland's early film appearances or the early use of 3strip technicolor .",0,1

"as good an advert for republicanism as you're ever likely to see , mayerlingis an everyday story of royal folk in late nineteenth century austria . set during one of europe's seemingly incessant internal turmoils it concerns itself with the emperor franz joseph mr james mason , his rebellious son , the crown prince rudolf mr omar sharifthe empressmiss ava gardner and various mistresses , secret policemen , spies , extravagantlyuniformed popinjays , gypsies , dancers , wives , soldiers , swans , horses and the bizarre inbred web of european royalty at the time of franz joseph's austrohungarian empire . filmed in what the old movie posters used to call a riot of color it resembles nothing more than an expensivelydressed but intellectuallychallenged production of the student prince . mr james mason , wearing a very natty little white number , utilises his allpurpose mitteleuropean accent whenever he remembers . i am a great admirer of his and i sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing . mr omar sharif , who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful , gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the crown prince . he is utterly unconvincing as a man who in the movie at leastcut a swathe through the distaff side of the austrian aristocracy . with his wellbuttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms . as a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk , leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes . unhappily married , he falls in love with a commoner . forbidden love is one of the movie's comeons . as she is played by the most uncommon miss catherine deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there . miss deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it , particularly in the sequence set at the ballet . now i love ballet as much as the next man , but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time , a more cynical critic might consider it to be padding . rudolf's mother , the empress is played by miss ava gardner . she gives the part some good old american oooomph , making her a bit like auntie mame , but it's done with undeniable style . rudolf is certainly very fond of his mother i'll put it no more strongly than that . the only performance worth watching is that of mr james robertson justice as sir lancelot spratt sorry , edward , prince of wales . he is so wonderfully unconcerned about everything going on around him it's a joy to behold . i waited vainly for him to ask rudolf the immortal question what's the bleeding time ? . i am not qualified to dispute mayerling 's historical accuracy , but , in my opinion , everything else about it is risible . it is a ruritanian opera buffa without the tunes to send you home from the theatre whistling .",0,1

"mabel at the wheel is one of those movies with a behindthescenes story that's more interesting than the movie itself . this was chaplin's tenth comedy for keystone during his year of apprenticeship , and his first tworeeler . here he played one of his last outandout villain roles although the featurelength tillie's punctured romance was yet to come , and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself . in fact , chaplin's conflicts with director and costar mabel normand almost got him fired from the studio . br br chaplin hadn't gotten along with his earlier directors , henry lehrman and george nichols , but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere girl was the last straw . charlie and mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film . chaplin was still a newcomer at keystone and his colleagues didn't know what to make of him , but everyone loved mabel . producer mack sennett was on the verge of firing chaplin when he learned that the newcomer's films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them a . s . a . p . , so chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way mabel wanted it . br br unfortunately , none of that drama is visible on screen in mabel at the wheel , which looks like typical keystone chaos . the story concerns an auto race in which mabel's beau harry mccoy is scheduled to compete , but wicked charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad , and mabel must take the wheel in his place . for all the racing around , brick hurling and fingerbiting the film is frankly short on laughs , but there are a few points of interest . there's some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence , though there aren't really any gags , just lots of frantic activity . chaplin himself looks odd , sporting a goatlike beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance , making a living , but the outfit suits the oldfashioned villainy he displays throughout . at least it's novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role . visible in the stands at the race track are such keystone stalwarts as chester conklin , edgar kennedy in a strangely dandified getup , and a more characteristic mack sennett , spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine . as a performer , sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced , but you have to give the guy credit he knew what people liked . these films were hugely popular in their day . mack's performance doesn't add much to mabel at the wheel , but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didn't kill each other .",0,1

"on the surface , this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation , that is how to become a true self by embracing the socalled 'dark' side of human nature . thus , we have the darkling , a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is , recognition of men , and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled , more or less successfully . br br however , if we dig a little deeper , we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene , the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter , when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl . lesson 1 cars are persons embodied with immortal souls , and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery . the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished . just after that , another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by the salesman . lesson 2 just like any other person , a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced . in addition , there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk , but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin's own personal greed for more profit . lesson 3 thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only , but always as an end in itself . then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and , more importantly , rubin's car the main character's assessment of the car's qualities is not just based on its outer appearance , but also by a thorough look inside the engine room . lesson 4 a car is not just to be judged by its looks , it is what is inside that really counts . there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind , as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector's car . this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson 3 . br br there are numerous other examples in the movie of the 'carperson'theme , and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them , but the point remains and i guess this is what i'm really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or , if you're a car devotee .",0,1

"'the fox and the child' is the new film by french director luc jacquet , who brought us the oscarwinning documentary 'march of the penguins . ' it focuses around a young girl wonderfully played by bertille nolbruneau and her blooming friendship with a fox . br br there are some truly mesmerizing moments here ; badgers mucking about , a lynx chasing the fox through a snowlittered forest ; one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times . however , there's simply not quite enough of them . br br beautifully shot ; the cinematography is dazzling . the bubbly kind of look of the film is wonderful . it's undeniably a very lush production . br br the english version is narrated by kate winslet , but what little dialogue there already is has been very poorly dubbed . the score is also far too fluffy , or at least it is for my liking ; and the screenplay , while subtle , seemingly jumps from one scenario to another , ultimately leaving me almost baffled . br br while there's a nice moral at the heart of the film , and the rather quiet performance from nolbruneau is quite lovely , the real star is the fox . those captivating moments focusing solely around our furry little friend are tremendous . however , again , there's simply not nearly enough of them . br br to keep up to date with all the latest in film , including reviews , news , discussions and more , be sure to visit www . mybluray . com . au",0,1

"chaplin was great a silent comedian , but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies . in my opinion , chaplin's voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous . his career never recovered when sound came to film . contrary to most of the reviews i have read , chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by chaplin the comedian , and not spend their entertainment dollar watching chaplin's political commentary . br br despite chaplin's awards and knighthood , i would take exception to his contributions to humanity . the great dictator was made at the same time stalin's brutal dictatorship was having it's show trials , and both dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of poland by both dictators . wwii started in an attempt to save poland . the nazi's were defeated in 6 years , but poland disappeared as a sovereign country . this happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of hollywood by the federal government . had chaplin included joe stalin in this satire , in addition to including the italian dictator , perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians . the soviet's mistreatment of jews and dissidents exceeded the nazi's in time and numbers . br br judged simply as a film , many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers , who wouldn't know who goebbels , goring or mussolini were . a classic piece of art must stand the test of time . classic greek tragedy , the mona lisa and beethoven's 9th are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless . films which rely on topical political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not outlast the generation in which they are made . but those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me . br br chaplin , as the writer , director and lead actor must take the blame for what i judge as a dated and tiresome film . br br chaplin's apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous . if chaplin found the us so offensive , why didn't he return to his native land . great britian fought the nazi'with blood and money . what did switzerland contribute in the fight against the european dictators ? switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class , and cares little about people who can't join the club .",0,1

"this film is another of director tim burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his vision' to the screen . he has done it with batman' , sleepy hollow' and now this . this is not a remake . the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak and charleton heston makes a cameo . burton has reconstituted the entire story , watering it down for today's mass viewership . br br the original planet of the apes was a product of its time . during the 1960's america was struggling to redefine its civilization . it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms . it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal . in that context , pota was allegorical , reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day . pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior . the dialectic between colonel taylor charleton heston , dr . cornelius roddy mcdowall and dr . zira kim hunter was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious . br br burton's version is as much a product of today's times as pota was of the sixties . this is apes for dummies . it is superficial and jejune , substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance . the surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel . while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene , burton's ending simply mocks the audience , taunting , i know something you don't know , and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out . 'br br from a technical perspective , as is always the case with burton's film , the film is excellent . the makeup is fantastic and burton's camerawork is outstanding though i continue to dislike his dark look . however , thirtythree years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script . br br the story has been reduced to a monster movie . the humans band together behind captain davidson mark wahlberg to fight the monstrous apes , aided and abetted by a few turncoats notably helena bonham carter as ari . the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence , perfect for today's fast food mentality . br br the acting is mixed . mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role . walberg is excellent at playing dark , sullen characters that are tormented but strong . this part requires an inspirational hero , a profile not in wahlberg's repertoire . helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable . she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character , but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager . br br then there is tim roth . his is a virtuoso performance , singlehandedly saving the film from total ruin . roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade . he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time . additionally , his physical acting is superlative , rendering a chimpman that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists . br br this film is a great disappointment . it is decent entertainment , as long as you check your brain at the door . i rated it a 310 . from a technical perspective it is much better than that , perhaps a 910 . however the story is an insult to the original franchise . it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation , using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is . of course it's true , but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films , instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption .",0,1

"for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series . it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series wallander , starring kenneth brannagh . people interviewed by the police are hardy , and often as bitter as the weather , the lead investigator has huge family problems , investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past , and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end . both have excellent cinematography . br br the plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series . effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequel . br br really the script couldn't be more obviously from the cookie cutter . you get even the most familiar of motifs , such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath , who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview . br br i'm absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk , but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television . what i felt a keen lack of was message . the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland . icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world , presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics . lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept , and many genetic diseases unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding , and is remarkably genetically homogeneous it's like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map , instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies . a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland . due to privacy concerns this project was terminated , and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in iceland . the episode is a rich topic for debate . br br but in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for education's sake , they're there for weird atmosphere . br br it's a grisly movie if you are interested in that , and there's often a morbid focus on food to accompany events , like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions . the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheep's head . unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical . the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental , and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end . this is the equivalent , in cinematic terms , of attempting to prepare fugu , if you're not wellqualified , deft of hand and sharp of eye , you poison the client . this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performance . br br i walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general .",0,1

"although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere , and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days , the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere . br br the film is about erroll babbage gere who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire . his office thrusts upon him his replacement , allison lowry claire danes , stardust , who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job . and that job ain't very fun . he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction . allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his flock of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement . but erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren't . he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them . erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts . it is this good justification that challenges the audience on some level , letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how outoftouch he's become by being too close to his job . br br when a teenage girl goes missing in erroll's area , he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock . but how could he know ? is erroll that good at his job ? allison challenges him and erroll pushes back . their battles become as fierce as erroll's need to find this missing girl . br br although the setup for the story was okay , it didn't have any umpf ! i will give credit to richard gere , however , who plays the erroll character very well . battling retirement . worried about everyone who's near his flock . disgusted with those he's responsible for overseeing . disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does . quite a change in character portrayal for gere . but beyond him there's not much else . some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughable . br br i'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films . but that suspension has limits . the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes . someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge nono . or trampling through a crime scene . or moving evidence . it went beyond and hurt the film to no end . br br the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes' character , allison . she's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be will she stay or leave ? will she end up like erroll if she does stay ? this isn't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground , but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up .",0,1

"the comparison is perhaps unfair , but inevitable . those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cutandpaste musical in the american style awkward , stilted dialogue with inexplicable songanddance numbers . gene kelly's french accent was apparently so poor , that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted as you'll remember , the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas . the translation of the french for subtitled versions , as well , leaves something to be desired , although this can't be attributed to demy . the film also has several selfaware moments that come off a wee disconcerting , such as references in songs to legrand himself . and the costumes well , the tight pantswhite boots combination , and the freakishly unnatural colors , reminds one of an austin powers film . . . br br but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas ; note , for instance , the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg . also , note the convenient brunette of resolution madeleine in umbrellas , and josette in young girls . br br generally speaking , those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas save the floating bicycle scene , or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrella's script , should probably pass this one b y . those looking for a french version of a thin '60s american musical will be quite happy .",0,1

"i have read several reviews that ask the question , why was this film made ? i myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle , only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end , when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort . so , why was this film made ? i think that is a great question for those watching heftig og begeistret to ask themselves . this reviewer is proud of director knut erik jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope , brotherhood , and inspiration with this all male choir , but i do not think that jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table . let me pose this question to you , do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest ? my answer is yes , and this is where jensen failed . heftig og begeistret was a good documentary , but it was far from great . jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects . it was great to hear the songs , but over time , those songs seemed dull , overwhelming , and a bit precocious . from the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow , i knew that i was hooked , but as the film developed i lost interest . why ? jensen never took us , the audience members , to the next level . he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film . was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir ? the world may never know . br br again , i would like to state that jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music , but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created . jensen gave us the music superbly , but it was the characters , the subjects , that i knew nothing about by the end of the film . in the mix we had a 97 year old man who still had his driver's license , we had a large man in a tub singing classic american songs , we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth , we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers , and we even had an exdrug addict that had only been clean for eleven years . did jensen develop these interesting stories at all ? nope , he left them on the table . it was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it see the political man who missed his political days , but jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing . to me , the music was defined at the beginning of the film , i wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men . they were all captivating , yet jensen seemed to ignore them completely . br br by ignoring the major subjects of this documentary , jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end . without giving the ending away , i felt like jensen was coloring in the lines . instead of being bold outside the lines , he chose to create no moment of sympathy , emotion , nervousness , or sadness . jensen took our subjects from point a to point b to point c without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form . i can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in norway , but for everyone else watching i . e . me more was necessarily needed . i wanted to feel for these guys . i wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled , or just find themselves loved in their own city . there was no story , mostly in part to no development of the subjects . when you watch modern documentaries oddly , this film was made in 2001 , you want it to play out similar to any hollywood feature film . you want suspense , realism , and drama , alas , with heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sort . br br overall , i must ask the question again , why was this film made ? my final answer alex , is that jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of earth . i think that jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population . with that said , jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film , but he did not create a good documentary . when you make a film of this nature , i feel that you must look within the group , examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart . the only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed . again , i do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty , but i needed more . with documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community , one expects a bit more than what heftig og begeistret handed to us . i want to see reality and people , not just another song and dance routine ! br br grade out of",0,1

"when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers , it was films like the garden of allah . how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me . also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me . br br the garden of allah , one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 191112 . it then got two silent screen adaptions . the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world . he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent . she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train . br br the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer . i'm not sure what was in david o . selznick's mind in filming this story . someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience . but you can bet that the moviegoing public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title . the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting . br br as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret . the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves . the monks are a sincerely pious group , but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest . br br anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts . most especially marlene dietrich . i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot .",0,1

"yeh , i know you're quivering with excitement . well , the secret lives of dentists will not upset your expectations it's solidly made but essentially unimaginative , truthful but dull . it concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice already a recipe for trouble if it wasn't for our separate worklives , we'd all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation . campbell scott , whose mustache and demeanor don't recall everyman so much as ned flanders from the simpsons , is the mildmannered , uberdad husband , and hope davis is the boredstiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera . one night , as dad the daughters attend one of davis' performances , he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera . one nice touch we never see the operadirector's face . dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation , divorce , and custody hearings profitable only to the lawyers scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wife's indiscretions . br br already , the literate among you are starting to yawn hohum , another story about the pathetic , sniveling little cuckold . but rudolph , who took the story from a jane smiley novella , hopes that the wellwornness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy , postmodern touches . for instance , one of scott's belligerent patients denis leary , kept relatively and blessedly in check will later become a sort of construction of the dentist's imagination , emerging as a devilontheshoulder advocate for the oldfashioned masculine virtues dump the bh ! , etc . . when not eggedon by his imaginary new buddy , scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a threeway with two of the male dentalassistants who work in their practice . it's not going too far to say that this movie is eyes wide shut for real people or grownups , at least . along those lines , campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of cruise and kidman . further , the script for secret lives is clearly more relevant than kubrick's . as proof , i offer the depiction of the dentists' children , particularly the youngest one who is about 3 or 4 years old , and whose main utterance is dad ! dad ! dad ! dad ! dad ! dad ! ! ! this is family life , all right , with all its charms . br br the movie would make an interesting doublebill with kramer vs . kramer , as well . one can easily trace the feminization of the american male from 1979 to 2003 . in this movie , dad is the housewife as in kramer , but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role , unlike dustin hoffman , who was too manly to make toast . here , scott gets all the plumb chores , such as wiping up the children's vomit , cooking , cleaning , taking the kids to whatever inane afterschool activity is on the docket . and all without complaint . and without directorial commentary . it's just taken for granted . br br the film has virtues , mostly having to do with verisimilitude . however , it's dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions , which culminate in a long scene where a horrible fiveday stomach flu makes the rounds in the household . we must endure pointless fantasy sequences , initiated by the imaginary ringleader leary . whose existence , by the way , is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in fight club . and this finally drives home the film's other big flaw lack of originality . in this review , i realize it's been far too easy to reference many other films . granted , this film is an improvement on most of them , but still . the secret lives of dentists is worth seeing , but don't get too excited about it . not that you were all that excited , anyway . i guess .",0,1

"a chicago couple , dillon and dougherty , are falsely accused of killing their daughter . people begin to wonder if they did it . the police investigate and find suspicious evidence . the couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press . the cops speculate that they are satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter . they are charged and brought to trial . they are represented by publicityseeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for 100 , 000 . the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police . fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented . their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home . dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed . verdict , she didn't do it but he did . he goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years . br br in the last third of the movie , with dillon in jail and dougherty wondering what to do next , we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couple's defense . witnesses admit to having lied . other facts are brought to light that , finally , result in dillon's release . the killer is never found , though the movie gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perp . br br this is a weeper from beginning to end . nothing seems to go right for the couple . oh , there are a few happy moment , maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy , or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another . but it's never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief . usually a fade to block follows . there isn't necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies , although i can't imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer . there's plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too . i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they're told . oh , but i am fortune's fool ! romeo cries after killing juliet's brother . here we have dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor , screaming , where's my baby ? ? ? there isn't any ambiguity or irony in the story as i'm sure there must have been in the real life events on which it's based . people are either good or bad here . or else they're bad , then they turn good . br br the film isn't aimed at exploring human quirkiness , or the way things work out . it's aimed at wrenching tears from the audience . the actors provide firstrate role models . i can't remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears . there are rivulets of tears . showers of them . cascades of them . a veritable niagara of them . a lake lacrymose of them . br br well , i'll give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted . dillon and dougherty hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator ed asner . asner is sympathetic to them but he doesn't really accomplish much . he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy learn to live with it , which is okay and because he suffers from colorectal cancer , so we can watch him take his medicine , double over with pain , and finally pass away . br br what's frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple , it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises the function of gossip in regulating private lives . br br gossip is a strange thing really . if we call it gossip it's bad , but if we call it public opinion it sounds acceptable , at the very least . of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified . as i write , michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy , and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile . but gossip isn't all bad either . it's like water . when it's properly controlled it's a community asset . we need gossip to keep each other in line . it helps us to maintain public order . but , like water in a flood or a tsunami , it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of control . br br this is a movie that's okay if you're not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature . it's done so cleverly that , given its goal , it's hard to argue with it .",0,1
"this was a very good show . i enjoyed the construction of real time and flashback , seeing the old diggers meeting again and recalling the terrors of their captivity in changi pow camp . the main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in changi are more like a holiday camp than what the place must have been like . i am old enough to remember film footage of the men being liberated from changi and other japanese pow camps . no actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance of the state of those men . they made the jews of belsen look like sumo wrestlers . i have met several veterans from changi over the years . many would never ride in a japanese car , let alone own one . the physical and mental torture those men endured was too horrific for them to even talk about . what percentage survived ? john doyle might be ok writing comedy for roy and hg i hate that too but this is a serious sugar coating of history that should never have been tolerated . i'm happy for satirists to write the life of brian and make fun of the crucifixion because it is obviously comedy , even if some consider it to be in bad taste . changi is written as a portrayal of a real event and , as such , might be regarded by younger people as a true record . great performances by a fine cast cannot redeem this lightweight screenplay .",0,1

"'helen of troy' follows the story of helen and the outbreak of the trojan war . this is more of a love story between helen and paris , who is shipwrecked and falls in love with helen without knowing she is queen . the film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together . other films and books have different portrayals of the characters , but in this one , they are simply hopelessly in love . the film is pretty slowmoving in some places , but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well . there are also some good performances . i thought that the slave girl did a particularly good job , and she was one of the most wellliked characters . br br overall , this is a good adaption if you can look beyond the slowmoving story in places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue . in my opinion , a perfect iliad film version has not yet been created , but this one is entertaining and does have some good bits .",0,1

"the brief existence of the sex pistols and the making of this film after the controversial , groundbreaking english punk band's breakup both happened before i was born . however , i started listening to their only album , never mind the bs , here's the sex pistols , in 2003 , when i was a teenager , and quickly became a big fan . i didn't see the great rock 'n' roll swindle until 2006 , but saw it a couple times that year , and thought it was pretty good certainly not great , but pretty good , even if i could only remember bits of it , and didn't see how it all connected . seeing it a third time , nearly three years after the second , i didn't care much for it at all . i'm not even sure what i found so good about most of it in the first place can't remember now . br br this film is a mockumentary , in which sex pistols manager malcolm mclaren tells his side of the story of the band and its members ; guitarist steve jones , credited here as the crook ; drummer paul cook , credited as the teamaker ; bassist sid vicious , credited as the gimmick ; and john lydon a . k . a . johnny rotten credited as the collaborator . mclaren claims that he created the band and even the genre of punk rock as a scam to make money . he tells much of the story to helen wellingtonlloyd a . k . a . helen of troy , in various places where they go together . it's basically a hodgepodge of mclaren talking , pistols songs , live footage of the band , fictional scenes often silly , strange ones , several cartoon sequences , etc . , all put together in one film , to tell the pistols manager's side of the story in a bizarre way ! br br it has been well proved that mclaren is a liar , i know many have already pointed this out , including band members themselves . he was not the driving force of the band , he didn't create them nor did he invent punk rock , and the sex pistols weren't even the first punk band , though they were unique . the band members were the ones who made the band what it was . the filth and the fury , a much more believable film about the band from julien temple , who made this film , is told from the point of view of the band members , who contradict mclaren's claims . however , the dishonesty of the great rock 'n' roll swindle is not my biggest problem with it . if it were actually entertaining which i used to think it was to a certain extent , i would be able to overlook that , like i obviously used to be able to do . during my third viewing , apart from sex pistols songs , some live footage , and at least one mildly amusing cartoon sequence , it was pretty dull ! i found the who killed bambi song mildly amusing at first , but it got tiring very quickly . br br is this mockumentary worth watching for sex pistols fans ? it seems a good number of fans would say it is , not to learn about the true story of the shortlived but groundbreaking 70's punk band , but for entertainment . that was once my opinion on the great rock 'n' roll swindle . after the first time i watched it , i couldn't remember a thing mclaren said , and by the time i saw it the second time , i was aware of what the pistols manager was using this film to imply , but could still barely remember anything i heard him say ! obviously , other aspects of the film were what i found impressive . now , after my third viewing , i can definitely remember some of the things mclaren says , but it still wasn't 100 clear . like most of the film , i guess his words are not that memorable , probably because of the way they're presented . if you're a pistols fan , i guess it wouldn't hurt to give swindle a try , but to me , for the most part , it's just an incoherent , boring mess that tries to be funny but fails .",0,1
"the sitcom the league of gentlemen follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village royston vasey . the different scenes are linked together by their common setting . br br in the first series , a sketch show , the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through royston vasey . consequently , more foreigners visit the small town . but edward and tubbs , the owners of a local shop , which is actually far away from the town , do not like foreigners . whenever a visitor enters their shop , they kill him . in my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all , for example , when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road . edward drums , while tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims . br br moreover pauline lives in royston vasey . she works at the local job centre . although pauline hates the people she has to work with , the woman does not want to loose her job . so when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman , she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet . br br then there is barbara dixton , a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about her sexual conversion . br br furthermore the vet , mr . chinnery , always kills animals instead of curing them . in one case , he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room , where a dog lays in his basket . the farmer goes outside . on the assumption that the dog is the sick animal , mr . chinnery euthanizes him . a second later , the farmer opens the door , holding the real sick animal , a sheep , in his hand . br br some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew his friend is killed by the shop owners , by the way . the couple is very tidy . they have , for example , towels in different colours . each colour stands for one part of the body . besides , they have thousands of keys , marked with different colours and precisely classified . br br in my opinion , the actors play very well . by playing women , the scenes become comical . the costumes are suited to the actors , too . tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters , for example edward , have unappetizing black teeth . the show has a great deal of dark humour , typical british . the set design reflects the mood of the series . the village and all the houses look grey and are decayed . around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect . even the village sign is ominous welcome to royston vasey . you will never leave . br br although i think that the actors do a great job , this type of series is not my taste .",0,1

"star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br ray ray winstone has a criminal past , has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife valerie kathy burke who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat . meanwhile , her mother janet laila morse is aware of ray's son , billy charlie creedmiles and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails . the film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives . br br it is said that the british seem to enjoy being miserable , and that would include watching films that entertain them this way . films like nil by mouth highlight this . it's a tale of a broken family , torn apart by crime , poverty , booze and drugs , the kind jeremy kyle would lap up like a three course meal . it is also essentially a tale of self destructive men , three generations apart and each copying the other , tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together , despite not being strong enough . if you pick up a little of what it's about from the offset , you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn't disappoint in this . br br it's true what everyone said about the performances , and the lead stars , winstone and burke , do deliver some great acting . we see winstone lose it with his wife , beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia , breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid . likewise , in a private moment , we see burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase , the full impact of the night before kicking in . br br this is another of those films where there's no 'plot' to follow , as such , just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next . it's been acclaimed by many including the baftas ! but it really was just too grim and bleak for me . i have no right to criticize it for this , knowing what i knew about it from the offset , but sadly this is how i found it .",0,1

"i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely , i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story . while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors . 1 . speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie . in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe . 2 . the asian nurse who survived speck's massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie . this would have been impossible . in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims . 3 . the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them . not true . in reality speck was at first calm and gentle , reassuring the women he wasn't going to hurt them . this is how he was able to tie each of them up . 4 . the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be . fbi profiler robert ressler interviewed speck in the 80's and said that speck not only did'nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why . speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie . if the story wasn't so tragic and horrifying , the voice over would be laughable . all in all , doug cole's performance is adequately menacing and coldblooded even though i don't think the real speck was so forward in his violence . no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known , after all , for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them . beverly ann sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film . she is a very good actress . if you are at all squeamish , do not see this film . it's very graphic and disturbing .",0,1

"rating 4 out of 10br br as this miniseries approached , and we were well aware of it for the last six months as scifi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads , i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned more . br br as with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time , different people go to it to see different things . in this regard , when people think of battlestar galactica , they remember different things . for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor . for others , it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time . many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s , especially those on television . for some the memories resolve around the story arc . others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced . br br frankly , i come from the latter group . the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire . yes , evil . the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it . while base stars were swirling around , men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources , and somehow they managed to survive until the next show . they didn't survive because they had better technology , or more fire power . they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show . br br the show had its flaws , and at times was sappy , but they were people you could care about . br br the writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this . in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show , the character's names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction . since that was their goal , they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure . it was far from a reinvention . in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time . it borrows liberally from sttng , stds9 , babylon 5 , and even battlefield earth . i find that unfortunate . br br ronald d . moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade , and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see . one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d e . that was the inviolable rule of roddenberry's sttng . like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority , ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene roddenberry . here , instead of writing the best story possible , he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could . besides being dysfunctional , some of it was not the least bit believable . anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack , they could have gotten execution , and they never would have gotten out the next day . it wouldn't have happened , period , especially in time of war . br br the thing that i remembered most of ron moore's earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt . james kirk . he killed capt . kirk , and , alas for me , he has killed battlestar galactica .",0,1

"dear readers , br br i've found in my studies of movies that whenever michael bay makes a movie , people pan it and hate it , yet they still go to see it and it makes somewhere around 100 million dollars . why ? because michael bay is one of the top five directors of all time . standing alongside ridley scott , spielberg , kubrick , and miyazaki , michael bay has cemented himself as hollywood's best actionadventure director . that point is proved with his most panned film , armageddon . br br an asteroid the size of texas is hurtling towards the planet and the only way nasa can think to take it down is to land a team of men on the asteroid , drill to its core , and drop a nuclear warhead inside then blow up the asteroid . only one person is qualified enough to do it bruce willis . willis portrays harry stamper , a grizzled hardened oil driller trying to keep what's left of his family together . not helping that fact is his daughter , grace liv tyler , having an affair with his best driller , aj ben affleck . hired by dan truman billy bob thornton , the head of nasa , stamper and his team of roughneck drillers train to become astronauts and save the world . br br armageddon is a two part movie . first there's the funny parts where we meet the gang and wackiness abounds . then they get into space and all the comedy gets sucked out the window and is replaced by mindblowing special effects , cool music , and great serious acting . murphy's law goes insane in the second part , meaning that everything that can go wrong , does in fact go wrong , increasing the tension of the film to outstanding levels . br br with a cool cast and crew michael bay as director , jerry bruckheimer and gale anne hurd as producers , and j . j . abrams as one of the scriptwriters . , tons of special effects , great humor , awesome music , plus an intro done by mr . benhur himself , charlton heston , armageddon rocks big time . br br signed , the constant dvd collector , matt macleodbr br parental warnings this is not a film for kids . the fbomb is used a few times and lots of other swear words are used as well , plus there's a strip bar scene and the extremely intense second part might be too hard for a kid to handle .",0,1
"the photography is accomplished , the acting is quite good , but in virtually every other department the greek tycoon is a dreary bore . taking its inspiration from the reallife love affair of jackie kennedy and aristotle onassis , the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on tv all day long . viewers who embrace the whole celebrity magazine culture paparazzi photographs and gossipy stories about the rich and famous will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here . but those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the 107 minute running time a buttnumbing slog . br br american president james cassidy james franciscus and his beautiful wife liz jacqueline bisset are in greece on official business . a ridiculously wealthy greek shipping tycoon , theo tomasis anthony quinn , catches sight of liz at a party at his elegant manor . despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else , there is an immediate attraction between them . later , at a private party aboard his yacht , tomasis makes his desires known to liz . some while later , president cassidy is assassinated whilst out strolling on a beach . liz is shocked and saddened by his death , but it isn't long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her greek lover tomasis . eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favourite talking point for the world's newspapers , magazines , photographers and wags . br br it is somewhat amusing to note the vigour with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatisation of the kennedyonassis story . they wanted the film to be seen as an original story , rooted in fiction . but anyone with a brain can see from where the movie is drawing its inspiration . even aristotle onassis himself knew the greek tycoon amounted to his lovelife getting the hollywood treatment if rumours are to be believed , he actually had a hand in approving anthony quinn for the tomasis role ! j . leethompson isn't really the right sort of director for this type of movie he's better suited to action fodder like the guns of navarone and ice cold in alex but he marshals the proceedings with an uninspired , professional adequacy . quinn is very watchable as tomasis ; bisset looks lovely as the object of his desires ; franciscus uses his toothy smile and a faade of integrity to make for a believable politician . their performances are good on the surface , but there's little for the actors to do on any deeper level . similarly , tony richmond's photography gives the film an elegant surface sheen as it moves from one exotic locale to the next , but the merest of scratches proves that there's nothing behind the film's glossy exterior .",0,1

"having some idle time before going to work , i looked at my 50 movie pack comedy classics dvd collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack zis boom bah starring a forgotten grace hayes . classics is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles i've never heard of and i suspect they're all in the public domain . anyway , this movie also stars her son peter lind and his wife mary healy who i just found out is a new orleans native from the state i live in , louisiana with benny rubin as a malt shop proprietor and huntz hall , taking a break from the east side kids , as peter's buddy . the plot , about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is , is for the birds and doesn't have many funny scenes though i did like peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with hall in drag . and the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves . rubin , however , is all over the place with his confusion of the american vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever though i did like his funny dance . since this was only 61 minutes that i'm sure played on the lowerhalf of the double feature bill , i'll be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that i mentioned enjoying .",0,1
"i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film . thought visually stunning like all of ang lee's work each still frame seems worthy of a print , i was really disappointed by the film's disjointed pace . it really was too long . br br the story is set in civil war era missouri , and is about a young man roedel who joins the feral forces of the bushwackers , sort of renegade confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the jayhawkers , their union counterparts . he and his close friend , jack bull chiles played by skeet ulrich , join the group after chile's father is shot pointblank and his home is burned , presumably by jayhawkers . the story follows roedel's and chiles' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war , including former slave who fights for the bushwhackers daniel holt played by jeffery wright , and a war widow played by jewel . br br it seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point , it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped . for example , the agitation among roedel's group caused by former slave holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol , and then dropped until later in the movie . a young villianbully bushwhacker hates roedel and directs much angst and violence against him , but , we never know why . some of the characters never seem to surface ; i think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history . br br the historical detail was excellent . i loved looking at the housing , furniture , clothes , etc . , and i thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters , though they stumbled a bit with the dialog . unless you really enjoy history or are a huge ang lee fan , though , take a pass on this one .",0,1
"i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall . i liked it , it showed great potential . i guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together by the filmmaker's own admission on the official site the short was exhibited as a roughcut . br br but nonetheless , it was an easygoing comedy . i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy . all they are supposed to do is make you laugh that's all . i did just that at its showing , so it succeeded on that level . just my 2 cents anyway .",0,1

"it's kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece . i am not a dullard as far as quality films go , and i will agree that from a technical filming standpoint , as well as for several of the characters portrayed , the film is in an awardworthy class . but there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere ; i mean , taking the viewer anywhere . it is a series of mood scenes , perhaps remarkable as such , but i want more from a film . i look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival , none of which did i find in this film . yes , it might be considered poetry on film . . . but there is much poetry that i cannot live with for the same reason that it paints pictures without going anywhere . br br one thing further to be said is that it documents a midcentury english childhood , which is necessarily limited in its universality . i was personally appalled at what a young british boy had to live through , in that time and place . having grown up in america just a decade earlier , i can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense . i cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably . in other words , could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its 'filmic magic' which i acknowledge is there and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one's actual recalled experience ?",0,1

"the wizard of menlo park was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007 even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants , he gave birth to the electric light , the phonograph , the motion picture camera , the electric car battery , the electric power grid possibly his most important but least recalled invention , the prefabricated house , and innovations to the telephone and telegraph , as well as the tickertape machine and an early voting machine . the total number of patents is over 1 , 000 far more than any other american inventor . br br but edison was a ruthless business competitor . he frequently had vast legal fights over the precedence of his inventions over rivals . the best example is the telephone , where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against alexander graham bell . actually edison's invention here was not the central idea that bell and gray had come up with independently of each other in 1876 , but an improvement on the sound quality of the phone receiver and transmitter that bell did not develop . still it was part of the huge 1888 supreme court decision that was the longest u . s . supreme court decision a single volume of their reports ! written by chief justice morrison waite which , by the way , killed the poor chief justice from overwork within weeks of completing it . br br in 1886 edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of electric power grids for large cities . this was george westinghouse , inventor of the railroad air break . westinghouse's firm had gotten the assistance of a new inventor , and former edison assistant , nicola tesla . tesla developed alternating current , which was a rival system to edison's direct current . edison's system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity . tesla's system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another actually it was a better , and more efficient system . but edison was determined to break this rival by a publicity campaign . br br it started with electric power lines . edison early on had his lines put underground , so that they would not be endangered by weather conditions . but westinghouse was forced to have his lines out in the open like telephone lines . when there were several accidental deaths by repair linemen on westinghouse's lines in particular one incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers in manhattan's business district , edison started insisting that a . c . current was far more dangerous that d . c . br br one result of all this was edison helping some subsidiary inventors with getting westinghouse a . c . generators and dynamos for an electric chair . edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair , but he helped several lesser figures along the way for the complete story read mark essig's edison the electric chair new york walker company , 2003 . br br edison experiment himself with cats and dogs experiments he was glad to show the public . in the long run , despite assisting in the invention of a new method of execution , edison failed to dislodge the public support of alternating current . but he never stopped trying . br br in 1903 he had an opportunity to combine his campaign against westinghouse and a . c . with his invention of the motion picture camera . he assisted in putting down a well known public elephant topsy who had killed several men . he did so by electrocuting the poor beast with a . c . but the entire killing is on film and one can view it to this day . it is a pitiful looking film whatever poor topsy had done it was a poor beast not a machiavellian murderer . the moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant , we are aware it will soon be over , but the sudden collapse of topsy is still an unpleasant sight to view . the film leaves a bad flavor in the mouths of modern movie audiences . yet , sad to say , it probably made a profit for edison his description of the film in his catalog of films shows real pride in his accomplishment here . in 1903 it may have been exciting entertainment for many americans watching it . one is glad that more people are appalled by it today sometimes one can sense the human race has improved a little bit .",0,1

"tart is the worst movie i've seen this year , and that includes both the affleckj . lo bomb gigli and the rob zombie borefest house of 1000 corpses . i don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that tart was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the lowbudget 1000 corpses . regardless , all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings horrible script , horrible acting , horrible direction . br br spoilers although i honestly don't think there's anything to spoilbr br tart is about a group of superspoiled private school kids . most of them reside in supersized apartments along new york's hyperexpensive park avenue , thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents . the film showcases the aimless life of one of the students cat as she discards her only true friend as frivolous a person as she was in the pursuit of the good life with the incrowd . that , of course , leads to sex , drugs , and music that is substantially worse than rock roll . everything is overly dramaticized in the way that truly bad movies usually are . cat's first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends ; her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose . no heavyhanded messages there , he said sarcastically . br br that's mainly what the seen it before 100 times plot entails . other minor , and even less interesting , plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others , a wild child who lives life on the edge and finally falls off of it one night in the east hamptons , an antisemitic british chick who ends her close friendship with cat the moment she finds out cat has a jewish father , and cat's strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get cat to appreciate the privileged life she has . the thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife . the wild child is played as a toned down version of one of the hilton sisters . the british girl disappears from the film after the breakup . the motherdaughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the film's final schmaltzy scene , where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts . yawnbr br end spoilers br br about the cast and crew . . . . dominique swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997's highly watchable lolita and faceoff . her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few onestowatch lists at the time . she was 17 at the time and i hope that they will not be the best roles of her career . if she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in tart , it very well may be . br br i've only seen bijou phillips in one other film bully and i swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here . i'm not sure if she's incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar . my guess is that the former is true . i sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned . here , she is the actress tapped to portray the watereddown hilton sister . that she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with , and remains friends with , the reallife hilton sisters . she's essentially playing a version of herself in this film , and doing a damn poor job of it . br br as for writerdirector christina wayne . . . i know nothing of her other than tart was her first , and only , film project to date . with a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was shortlived .",0,1

"i didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of canadian history , particularly the disservice done to the history of the mounted police in the yukon . br br i'll leave it to pierre berton , noted historian , born and raised in dawson city yukon , and author of the definitive history of the klondike gold rush , klondike the last great gold rush , 18961899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie br br the american idea of an untamed frontier , subdued by individual heroes armed with sixguns , was continued in the far country , another story about a cowboy from the american west wyoming this time driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country . the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities , but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness . when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle , the customs shack is empty . br br where is the constable ? asks brennan . br br up on the pelly river . trouble with the chilkats , someone replies . he's got a real tough job , that constable . he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles . sometimes he don't get home for two or three months at a time . br br the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen . the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike . they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense . they collected customs duties , often over the wails of the new arrivals , made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation , and turned men back if they didn't have enough supplies , or if they simply looked bad . in true canadian fashion , they laid down moral laws for the community . in dawson the lord's day act was strictly observed ; it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday ; and plump young women were arrested for what the sternfaced police called giving a risqu performance in the theatre , generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights . br br in such a community , a gunbelt was unthinkable . one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable , who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly . the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman , upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over . no man has yet taken a gun away from me , said the american . well , i'm taking it , the constable said mildly and did so , without further resistance . so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece . br br in 1898 , the big year of the stampede , there wasn't a serious crime let alone a murder in dawson . the contrast with skagway on the american side , which was a lawless town run by soapy smith , the denver confidence man , was remarkable . but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law , which a soapy smith character from skagway he is called gannon in the picture can easily control . in real life , one of smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant . br br in the movie the lone mountie says yes i'm the law . i represent the law in the yukon territory . about fifty thousand square miles of it . br br then why aren't there more of you ? br br because yesterday this was a wilderness . we didn't expect you to pour in by the thousands . now that you're here , we'll protect you . br br when ? br br there'll be a post established here in dawson early in may . br br what happens between now and may ?

"i agree with the majority of the comments i have seen written . i grew up watching seseme street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born . i was born in 1964 , so i was 5yrsold when seseme street was introduced to television . the show taught me my numbers the count , spelling the muppet , and about life . i liked all the old characters big bird , oscar , grover , and cookie monster and don't quite understand why they had to change . i understand that everything has to change in some way , but to make cookie monster into a veggie monster to promote healthy eating . the show has introduced new characters and monsters since it's inception , why not make a separate veggie monster that talksdiscusses the benefits of eating a varied diet with cookie monster . but , back to my point . i grew up watching the very beginning of seseme street , my now 20 yrold daughter grew up watching ss with me along side her , and we discussed mr . hooper dying , although he had died prior to her being born , as well as other topics on the show . i saw the episode as a older child , and still remember how well they portrayed the event , much like real life . and i'm sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and losses effect families . you saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events . the show has talked about traditional families , adoptive families and combined families . it's one of the few shows that actually discusses these scenarios . i now have a 5 yrold daughter who really doesn't watch ss . i've tried to watch the show a couple of times , but , it really is not what it used to be . the elmo 12 hr with mr . noodle is absolutely ridiculous . like many people have said , it doesn't teach anything . it's geared for the less than 18 month old maybe , and isn't even funny . i always prided myself on watching ss as a child , teen , and adult with my own child . now on my second goround , i really have a hard time watching ss . the topics that were discussed death , marriage , nontraditional families , new to neighborhoods , moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for 299 year old to understand and relate to . now , there are no concepts taught , minimal counting , only the occasional mention of the alphabet . it is not the same ss , from an original watcher of the show . please if any producers from the show read these comments , return the show to its foundation . new concepts have never been a problem with ss , they just used to have a better way to incorporate them into the show .",0,1
"i saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though i knew it wasn't of award winning caliber . . . i kinda liked it . it tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids which is to climb mt . whitehead . of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways , but none too differently than they were as children . richard lewis is still neurotic , richard belzer is still a playboy , franklyn ajaye is still sort of the dear abby of the group , and tim thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group . of course the top billed star is louie anderson , a true believer in everything cub scout related . he still lives in the same house with his mother , still goes over the cub scout manual daily , is brave , reverent and clean , and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in scouting . compounding their task , however , is the grunski brothers , two bullies drummed out of the cub scouts by the above mentioned . by coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit , albeit harmlessly . not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts , who think pack 7 is from the fbi and are intent on wiping them out . all in all , the movie still has bits of charm . observe richard lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot , for example , and you have a really funny bit going for you . upon further review , the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor . it doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure .",0,1

"welcome to our town , welcome to your town ? as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 america , this three act play is opened before us with the help of the stage manager , a visual narrator if you like . after his initial introductions , we are lead into the homes of two particular families ; the webb's and the gibb's . br br this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century , and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town . here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of grover's corners , new hampshire , even if there are , too , the migrant polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers , they , never get a lookin . br br once the daily lives of these families have been introduced ; wives cooking , children homeworking , fathers working , kids falling in love and the clean picketfences painted white , the second act is started three years later , after young george a young and unrecognisable william holden , then aged 22 and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry . blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching , too , a turning point in their own lives , from the nest they lived and now , into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step . the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding , it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent , here we see not life , not celebration but death , and it is in this predicament that the dead , as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past , are here to remind us , to tell us , that life , and every last minute , every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered . br br it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too , feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on , and by , middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order . this isn't just about our town , this is moral diction aimed at our souls and how america can better itself if its peoples' , excluding the poles , the irish , the native american and the freed ethnic minorities' , and minorities' in general , plus the supporting backbone of the americana's who , still , have not had a fair part in this narrative , such as the middle classes , can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest , decent living . the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only . br br i was entertained , slightly , by this movie too , but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting , the musical score or how well , or not , it was made . this was the movies intention to exclude other groups , and to only include the likes of the webb's and the gibb's , in the future of the developing country of the usa , a good movie , but also a slightly biased in its stance , i thought . br br taken from the play by us' born thornton wilder 1897 1975 this pulitzer prize winning play , and six academy award nominated movie , was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes ; life , love and death , the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness . our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness , like other towns , nothing too exciting ever happens here , if anything at all , this town only has the right sort of people , you can still leave your backdoor unlocked here , we are seeing the developing lives of these two families , but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves . our town may just have been any town , just as long as you came from the right part of town that is .",0,1

"like a latter day ayn rand , bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough american hombres stuck in iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless , relentless , childkilling arab terrorists . as bigelow posits the iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama , one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty , hot , ugly rubble that is iraq , and a new hero is born . br br the new guy is what john hershey described in his book , and later the movie , the war lover , as a sadistic wingnut who actually isn't fit for civilian life , and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires . the war lover can only fully function in war , peacetime suffocates him . while hershey chastised the war lover , played in the film by steve mcqueen in one of his greatest roles bigelow glorifies him . the army needs war lovers , they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies . we can't handle the truth , that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers , the toughest men . according to the unironic bigelow , regular men are pussies , the war lover is a special breed , the last of the cowboys . so what if he wants to bareback his men , or fondle an iraqi boy ? he is a throwback to the sexanddeath cult of war . in war , sex is a thankless , loveless , don'task , don'ttell kind of male bonding . bigelow has no opinion on this ; she just limits the options of masculinity in this hamfisted attempt at realism . only a warlover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong , between american innocence and arab perfidy . bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism . she's just another gungho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit . br br on the political front , bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clichs again and again , ad nauseam the wonderful world of the open frontier , which happens to be some one else's country . you can shoot people here says a soldier ; the tough but human black guy companion , the soldier with a premonition of death , the gruff , possibly crazy commanding officer , the collegeeducated fool who tries to befriend the enemy . you name it , bigelow resurrects it . br br the manboy love is palpable in scenes with the cute arab boy who befriends the war lover , but bigelow plays it straight ; she doesn't consummate the sex , just sanitizes it . what bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly , sneering face of the arab enemy . any iraqi who isn't pure evil is either demented , hostile or up to no good , anyway . they all deserve to die for their impudence , and many of them do in this glib gorefest film . the iraqi women are all hysterical , they only make their presence known by screaming . they could be male stunt men in drag for all i know , you never see their faces . there is no female presence at all on base or in battle , although female casualty rates in iraq would certainly disprove this . br br bigelow goes through all the motions one by one . she glorifies war , she canonizes the sadist nutcase hero . the cowboys , surrounded by the subhuman indians , prove their mettle by doing god's work and subduing the wretched terroristinfested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania . toward the end , i felt like rooting for the indians . in bigelow's world , though , no mercy or understanding ever makes it through . the iraqis are dehumanized par excellence . the slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our hero's psycho sexual struggle . every u . s , bullet finds its mark . you have to love the guy , the war lover . it's just his way , he is the true hero . he's just a guy trying to get things done the hard way , and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side .",0,1

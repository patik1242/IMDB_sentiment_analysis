"i'm not here to tell you armored is kubrickian , hitchcockian or fellini esquire . nope . referenced directors are more like don siegel charlie varrick and walter hill the warriors . those two helmers didn't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies . no skirts need apply . they unapologetically made guy movies . guns , lots of guns . men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw . their movies were like a sap to the head . you want a friend ? get a dog . armored is so a guy movie . dueling armored trucks ? bloody gunshot wounds ? exploding money ? if that doesn't get the lizard part of your brain excited , then stay away . at 88 minutes , armored is all muscle without an ounce of fat . we meet six security guards who drive armored trucks , three per truck . the six , led by matt dillon , scheme up a fake hijack involving two trucks . their mission one day is to deliver 42 million from the federal reserve i think . the idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse , stash the cash , then stage a hijack . sure , the cops will suspect them , but if they stick together they'll get through it . trouble is , one of the six , played by columbus short , is a holdout . at first . but he faces eviction . and he's the guardian for his messed up younger brother . he needs cash bad . matt dillon cajoles , pleads , persuades the holdout . no blood on anyone's hands . a clean getaway . all good , no bad . you'll be rich forever . blue skies smiling at you . right . everything goes to hell , of course . it's one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up . and it almost all happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in los angeles . in fact , the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay . i happen to like industrial urban decay . kudos to matt dillon , who plays the top bad dog . he goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally effing insane in the course of the movie . love that guy . also , credit is due to the menacing , throbbing , blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by john murphy . i am guessing he's heard a few tangerine dream records . also , it's surprising that this is a pg 13 movie . i caught one one ! f bomb in this entire movie about violent tough guy robbers . on some level , i like that . take the kids . the director is nimrod antal , a hungarian who made a fine noir set in the budapest subway system called kontroll . screenwriter is an out of nowhere guy called james v . simpson . a lot of the people in this movie are just starting out . i am willing to bet the esteem given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers .",1,0
"as far as christian film goes , it's typical . lacking of a mega budget they try their best . some times falling short , sometimes hitting the mark . this one almost hit , great acting can only carry a movie so far . a combining of h . p . lovecraft , and frank peretti was a good idea . all's it needed was better back story , and better character development to make it great movie . the visuals are not that bad , also smart holding off the demons till the last few minutes helped keep the suspense at a good pace . could of used a better ending though . not a bad premise having terrorists experiments go wrong . much better than typical hollywood treatment about the demonic realm . maybe someone will finally do this present darkness as a movie .",1,0
"this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . that would be fine if the film were a travelogue , but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry , that is not good enough . the theme of inter species respect and co operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter species love , but its approach is stereotypical , indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species . as with many films , one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter . alas , we probably will never know .",1,0
"hmmmm , want a little romance with your mystery ? this has it . i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie . but how could the romance be ditched when the story's borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel , whatever the heck that is . had the romance been ditched , the story might have been a little too weak . the mystery here wasn't too bad , quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage . oh well . i thought mel harris was pretty good ; her short skirts , i think , added some sex appeal . but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast , maybe with a more well known tv movie actor . the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on both could have been a little edgier , a little darker , more adventurous . one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations . that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest . possibly a drawback was the director and or cinematographer's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect . not good . had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen , picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background . this was just a tv movie , though , so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery . overall , twasn't really a bad movie . i'll tell you what , this was absolutely the best canadian hungarian production i have ever seen ! and the only that i know of . i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made for tv movie , giving it a grade of c",1,0

"i found this film to be the usual french slap in america's face . the camera , all too often , focuses on fat people , on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas . while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer , the cinematography exploits and demeans them . there were , undoubtedly , thin people to be seen in glencoe and neat , organized homes , but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen . i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements . i can assure you , as a frequent visitor to france , that all is not well there . foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated , thus creating severe social inequities . but americans are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the u . s . , so we're not likely to see films on the subject .",1,0
"i waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when i first saw it over 10 years ago , i wanted to think carefully about what i wanted to write . i found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary . it did what it set out to do , show me something i had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored . i knew nothing of the drag world and finding out about them and the balls was just spectacular to me . these folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it , for competition . the catty folks , the complainers even i was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen was wearing wasn't a man's coat ! , the jealous , it's all there like in every other competition . like every other competition like it . which i felt was a point . you had the older drag queen talking about how the balls used to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories and even those who looked on knowing that the future of balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway . it was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete , it was that important to them ! then there was sad stories , stories of who's house and house mother brought out the best and the brightest in competition . it was interesting . now to add after 10 years of seeing this film , i lived through the so called 'madonna' craze . i spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with madonna during her vogue phase and rightfully so . if not for those individuals , madonna wouldn't have had a vogue phase , i know that now . credit should be given where credit is due . makes me wonder , if anyone else from mainstream america would watch this documentary , they'll learn they're not as mainstream as they think .",1,0
"an enjoyable movie , without a doubt , and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage' . but i have to say that having read the very positive comments here , i was a bit disappointed . the period was captured , but the plot was desperately thin . the whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays . the idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns , but a philanderer , is risible . and without that , nada . the sub plots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story which surely suggests a fundamental flaw . when all your sub plots look like padding , you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits . nevertheless , it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place , there are some fine performances , and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final 'cut ! ' that good feeling permeates the film . and that has to count for something . a flawed really quite good movie . 7 out of 10 .",1,0

"vincent price's follow up to house of wax 1953 , the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon , similarly revolves around a bitter albeit resourceful showman . though a remake , the former shot in technicolor remains the superior effort ; that said , apart from some resistible comic relief , the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry it was another 3 d showcase and occasional narrative shortcomings whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head ? , this offers more than enough grand guignol type thrills and overall camp value price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating 'missing' star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius to stand on its own two feet . incidentally , director brahm's involvement here proves no mere coincidence since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles both starring laird cregar he had previously helmed i . e . the lodger 1944 and hangover square 1945 . the young leads are played by mary murphy as price's ing nue assistant and patrick o'neal as her police detective boyfriend curiously enough , he would himself take the lead in a similar piece , chamber of horrors 1966 , which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one . an interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a novel detection technique , fingerprinting , which is crucial in bringing about price's downfall in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run ! watching the star in a made to measure role , the film emerges a good deal of fun particularly at a compact 73 minutes .",1,0

"watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s , a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as die hard in a on a . cliffhanger is die hard on a mountain , and pretty good , for what it is . but unlike passenger 57 and under siege , which are decent die hard clones on their own terms , cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that , in their immensity , threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks . years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations , cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings . the opening sequence has already received substantial praise , all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening . not even harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal , which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in deep blue sea , or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite's face , can dim the sequence's power . the next impressive set piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet . as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin , the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody double crosses are completely unexpected . as roger ebert has observed , the stuntman who made the mid air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition . later , during the avalanche sequence , one of the terrorists thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain . so far as i know , no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle , considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts , so obviously a dummy was used for the shot . but the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how harlin or more likely one of the second unit directors knew exactly where to place the camera . i'll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week , because he's one of the few movie stars i've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain , and at the same time actually feels that pain . the role of gabe walker really complements stallone's acting strengths he plays an older , more vulnerable kind of action hero , giving an impressively low key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself . in contrast to many of today's post matrix , comic book inspired action heroes , stallone's walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer enhanced abilities . in cliffhanger , the hero almost freezes to death , and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another . he winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut , particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky style pummeling from one of the mad dog villains . it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness when i first saw this movie as a teenager , i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather , the ice ; at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise . lithgow's british accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter , but he's fundamentally a good actor , and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene , looking at his hostages stallone and rooker , trying to decide which tasks to give them , he actually says you , stay ! you , fetch ! even a better actor , such as anthony hopkins , might have had trouble with that line . even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside , it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show . early in the movie , for example , lithgow openly says to one of his men retire stallone when he comes down . no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face , and this precipitates a gripping tug of war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg . lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means , but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor . done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or at times a western , cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film . besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before , the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow , as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action packed narrative . finally , harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless , since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes . it's a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies , because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later . but perhaps it's best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time , without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already . there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit compared to that clinker , cliffhanger belongs on the imdb's top 250 list . rating 8 very good , especially considering most of stallone's other movies .",1,0
"no , this hilariously horrible 70's made for tv horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake . still , this exceptionally awful , yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute , unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so execrable it's downright awesome sort of way . richard crenna , looking haggard and possibly inebriated , and yvette mimieux , who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in jackson county jail , sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint , dull , sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit . pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann the psychic alien moppets from the disney witch mountain pictures are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty , ugly canine entity in the den . boy , now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing ? well , scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't , but it sure is funny , thanks to curtis night tide harrington's hopelessly weak direction , cartoonish not so special effects , an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot , and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story besides the leads , both martine beswicke and r . g . armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman . favorite scene the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna , practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade . while stuck up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock , devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo .",1,0
"ok , so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers , but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted , right ? right ! consider yourselves officially warned , and read on . in this parody tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history the 1980's a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious murder mcgee , who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard . as i'm sure you can guess , things go from bad to worse faster than you can say where's the beef ? and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody , the dialogue is cheesy , and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get . good times . no clique or 80's horror movie clich d characterizations are left unrepresented here . in fact , no stone was left unturned at all we have the cool hero , his innocent girlfriend , the goth chick , the tough thug think john bender , the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt , the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt , a couple of gorgeous half naked lesbians , and two big geeks . as you can plainly see , the cast is pretty big . usually , larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly , with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel . not in this case though . not a single cast member left me disappointed . the acting was very well done . everyone from the cool hero in his thriller jacket played by jovan meredith to the grooovy goth chick played by renee dorian to geeks one two played by cory assink jonathan brett they all played it straight , brought their a game , and knocked it out of the park . if you're a fan of gary wyatt in weird science , you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks . director co writer jeff c . smith is a guy to watch for in the future , trust me on this . if this is what he can do with a low budget , there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects . the characters were dead on ; the atmosphere was perfect ; the laughs were huge ; the blood flowed , and squirted , and sprayed beautifully it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980's . call this one the breakfast club meets night of the demons ! the tag line says it all , and says it honestly excessive violence ; gratuitous nudity ; zero budget no false advertising here , folks ! as fans of this genre , we have to look to the indies and support these hard working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales , lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered down pg 13 'horror' or pointless remakes like the hitcher . no , thank you no more of that for me . in closing , i honestly have to say that stupid teenagers must die ! is by far one of the best indie flicks i've gotten the pleasure of watching this year . it's a bloody good time , and holds up on repeat viewings . from the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe . even the closing love theme over the end credits which if that doesn't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid 80's power ballads by reo speedwagon over pronounced r's on every word starting with the letter 'r' then i'll eat my dvd right now . bottom line is , if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general , no more hesitation this flick deserves to be in your collection !",1,0
"i would like to start by saying i can only hope that the makers of this movie and it's sister film the intruder directed by the great unheralded stylist auteur that is jopi burnama know in their hearts just how much pleasure they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north eastern town of jarrow . from the opening pre credit sequence which manages to drag ever so slightly despite containing a man crashing through a window on a motorbike , the pitiless destruction of a silence lab , the introduction of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anaemic bad guys in movie history and costume design that jean paul gautier would find ott and garish . make no mistake ; this is a truly unique experience . early highlight an explosion get used to it , plenty more where that came from ! followed by a close up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word dad in living memory . and then . the theme song . yeah , this deserves its own paragraph . sung by aj , written by people who really should wish to remain anonymous , it makes the songs written for the rocky films sound like schubert . this is crap 80's hero motivation narcissism at an all time high , with choice lyrics such as its only me and you , its come down to the wire and much talk of having to cross the line it'll make sense in time our hero cares little for the boundaries of bona fida police work abounding . not to mention the indonesian supremes cooing the film's title seductively . at this point anyone wishing to switch off officially has no pulse . our hero is semitic cop peter goldson essayed brilliantly by intruder star peter o'brien , the stabilizer of the title . the man's bull in a china shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his less than inconspicuous undercover work truly leaves much to be desired , but he is without question an entertaining guide through the mean streets of downtown jakarta , with local sleaze ball connection captain johnny in tow , as well as peter's own waste of space partner in fashion crime sylvia nash , who does little . so many highlights , so little time the slide please arrogance of peter's not all too convincingly argued case against chief baddie greg rainmaker intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard craig gavin as the monstrous john white helluva name eh ? no ! oh well . , the x marks the spot location map stupidity , our hero taking horrible advantage of heroine tina probost during a moment of weakness on her behalf , the latter turning up at a sting operation dressed like a member of a particularly flamboyant dancing troop . and believe me that barely covers it . there wasn't even time to go into the plot revolving around the hunt for a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride . or our hero turning up at a funeral dressed as if an extra on boogie nights . or the absolutely hysterical craic between captain johnny and goldson two guys have never made more heavy weather of buddy buddy shtick than these clowns . the trowel was possibly too subtle me thinks . ah it tails off people , and you never thought scenes of wanton destruction and general mayhem could be so unbelievably boring , but the character interaction is stupendous , the dialogue truly priceless and the incompetence on show somehow endearing . oh and the shoes people watch out for the shoes !",1,0

"these slasher pics are past their sell by date , but this one is good fun . the valentine cards themselves are witty , and well thought out . the film has one peach of a line . he's no angel . when he in fact is angel ! watching buffy reruns will never be the same ! the cast is a sizzling display of young talent , but the story does not give them enough real depth . denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters . sorry but no ! the direction is very good , managing to show very little actual gore , and relying on your imaginations implied threat . much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes . essentially , the main directorial plus , lies within the borrowing of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks . psycho's shower scene is tributed , along with halloween's masking . murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know ! light viewing , not very scary but a few good jump moments . if it was a choice between the hole and this though , choose the hole . slasher movies have had their day , and this is just another slasher . a very good slasher , but nothing groundbreaking !",1,0

"when i sat down in the cinema to see this i was expecting to see a sort of stylish tongue in cheek action film , which had been implied by the trailers . however , it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be more . normally , i don't approve of films that try to entertain in as many ways possible . for instance , this film tries to mix action with comedy , romance , lightheartedness and gritty seriousness all at once . most of the time this sort of approach doesn't work in films just look at batman forever but i was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case , they pulled it off . the end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature cinemagoers . however , the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes . robert carlyle and jonny lee miller pull of a brilliant double act and ken stott does a excellent villain . this mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch . however , the big let down here for me is that in having 'the gentleman highwayman' there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in punchiness and there were few belly laughs . okay , so the lines weren't terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent british films ; ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of hollywood's efforts .",1,0

"you'd be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie especially one entirely located inside a us prison see this to prove yourself wrong ! it was produced in the 80's after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to 100m budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind ! being mr harlin's first major production and the at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar cast . i still think most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard's screen appearances not mentioning the well overrated mr s bergman directorial efforts at least for all female viewers but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense . do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror puff , imo it's definitely worth it !",1,0

"this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival . but unlike yes , by sally potter , which i had seen some days before , where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive , this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down , and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe . it was as if , all of a sudden , there was nothing left , all hope , all future had been taken away to a dead place . nina's life seemed to be dismal and locked , but then , one lovely day , there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams . there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion , just out of nothing , someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life . that person was toni , a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots , just like herself . but the film's title is ghosts , and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish , there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people , strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself , hiding away from all other people . fran oise , a french woman , is a victim of such ghosts . she once lost her child daughter in berlin , who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket , in just one moment of inattentiveness . now time has passed , and fran oise is back in berlin , still looking for the missing child . nina could be that child , after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity . and nina adopts that idea , after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion , she also longs for a mother . but in the end she is empty handed , toni has disappeared with a man , and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman . marie is dead , concludes fran oise's husband , and the statement could not be more disillusioning . nina is just a ni a , a girl without name , there is no hope for any divine fulfillment . there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives . therefore , in the end , we see nina all alone , about to walk along the road that has opened up before her , into a future that seems joyless and uncertain .",1,0
"sam firstenberg's ninja 3 the domination mixes martial arts with the exorcist like horror . the horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable , but the film works as a mindless action martial arts flick . the fight scenes are well choreographed and exciting , and the film is never boring . so forget stupid dialogue , lame acting and annoying soundtrack grab some beer and check this one out ! highly recommended !",1,0
"a pleasant surprise ! i expected a further downgrade along the line the rock 9 con air 7 armaggeddon 4 . especially for such an overhyped film . perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare . clever dialogue instead of snappy one liners , decent background motivation instead of shake n bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it . fanboys expecting an armageddon rollercoaster stay away . this is one for the more intelligent action fans . it didn't even bother me jolie appeared so little .",1,0
"i'm not a fan of this brand of comedy stereotyped characters over acting their way through a cops and robbers farce . but there are enough likable characters to sustain interest . michelle pfeiffer is adorable , but the person really carrying the film is dean stockwell , who steals every scene as the head mobster named tony , no less . stockwell's performance is the reason i'm writing this review and the only reason i'd recommend it , in fact . you'll be tickled by his screen time . he's plays the mob boss perfectly , with comedic touches in the right places , managing to avoid becoming an overbearing cliche . in fact , stockwell's a complete delight to watch a master of the 'double take , ' and a real 'looker' in those classy suits and fedoras . meesa says a good film to watch while folding laundry or eating leftovers .",1,0

"aaah . the thing . to see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty , but distinctly unattractive , makes a refreshing change , and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters , rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover . and carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over styled parodies . and there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending , or cameo celebrity appearance , or lame pseudo romantic subplot . and i really miss on set physical effects ; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics . in the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw alien , the elephant man , poltergeist , the howling , an american werewolf in london , the thing , the company of wolves , a nightmare on elm street . what an era for horror effects ! and don't get me started on the death of matte painting . the matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless . what do we have now ? third rate cgi , former music video directors and professional stylists , that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy mtv videos . now i'm going to go netflix 'the howling' .",1,0
"this movie deserves the 10 i'm giving it . but it's not the 10 that you'd give to movies like 'the godfather' or 'goodfellas' or 'psycho' . this is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh , over and over again ! it's the most horribly written and directed movie , yet it doesn't fail to entertain . it has the most amateur effects , yet you enjoy every moment ! i saw this movie today on tv , and i didn't want to move away ! read the following dialogue to know why ! whole college is standing around manisha , who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness bad guy 1 please forgive us ! bad guy 2 yes , we won't do it again . no response from manisha akshay come on , forgive them ! manisha i don't know . akshay you are a beautiful woman , and even dead men can get aroused by you ! and these are living young males ! don't blame them ! pancholi yeah manisha . manisha to suniel what if they tried to rape your girlfriend ? suniel i'd break their hands , legs and kill them . but anyways , just forgive them . akshay yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty ! now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue ! this movie never fails to entertain , mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations ! the bad guy munish can do basically anything . he can blow a sandstorm from his mouth , or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again . every actor takes turns to speak . one line from akshay , then from suniel , then from arshad , then aftab , then nigam . it's the main rule followed by the director , so that equal screen time is given to each guy . and then there's the all powerful pendant , which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed ! all these things make it an enjoyable movie , and i can watch it over and over again . i think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one . the only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny .",1,0
"i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening . i gathered from the ads that it was a thriller . what we have is like compulsion meets matlock . two teens decide to commit a perfect murder . a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual murderers is found . then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander . innocent of the murder anyway enter sondra bullock as the investigating officer . imdb says that she's fbi , but i don't remember that . i thought that she was a regular cop she's frustrated by the inconsistency of the killers profile the profile doesn't fit the profile ! and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys . she's also has demons of her own which figure prominently in her decicision to become a cop . but this is the only character that is really more than one dimensional . all others are pretty flat . for a thriller , there are really no big thrills . it's mostly a cat and mouse game like an episode of matlock which she's watching at one point in the film . the twist is that there are two involved in the killing . just who is the real murderer , justin or richard ? it'll cost you eight bucks to find out .",1,0
"the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in . people come looking for a b grade horror film , or a so bad it's good movie . jack frost 2 is neither of these . it is , to put it simply , a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one . to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless scary movies combined is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level . it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions . the premise is simple ; the characters from the first movie , haunted by memories of jack frost , take a vacation to a tropical island . a new , improved jack comes after them , now with essentially the powers of hydro man from spider man ; essentially , he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly , divide himself , multiply himself , and , worst of all , he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness . antifreeze . what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost a simply horrible movie can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel . just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action , jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre . most of the entertainment comes the live action actors , who serve admirably . particularly funny among them are ray tooney playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s , christopher allport offering an insane , hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film , and david allen brooks taking the once serious role of manners to new , totally bizarre heights . the lack of memorable quotes disturbs me . as a horror movie , jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman , rates a zero . but you have to understand , it's not a horror movie .",1,0
"i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it . it actually exceeded my expectations . considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well made film . the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways , especially given the plot . just like the blair witch project , this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film . another bonus whereas most low budget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocre to unintentionally hysterical acting , this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters , particularly the two leads . the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline . it borrows heavily from better known films like deliverance and wrong turn but if you're like me , films of this nature never cease to be terrifying . plus , the director keeps things interesting throughout . i'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out .",1,0

"how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this ? i can't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint . i was reminded so often of other movies , it became a big distraction . one of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 day after tomorrow . one line by itself , is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk . but . see the movie ! despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever . while borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard . in fact , you'll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out . why ? . costner and kutcher played their characters very well . i have never been a fan of kutcher's and i nearly gave up on him in the guardian , but he surfaced in good fashion . costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of costner's ability . i don't think mrs . robinson had anything to do with his success . the supporting cast all around played their parts well . i had no problem with any of them in the end . but some of these characters were used too much . from here on out i can only nit pick so i will save you the wear and tear . enjoy the movie , the parts that work , work well enough to keep your head above water . just don't expect a smooth ride . 7 of 10 but almost a 6 .",1,0

"this movie's origins are a mystery to me , as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it . i assume that before starship troopers , killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network , cable , or otherwise . the new title of kill shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence , the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema . the quick cuts , cheesy melrose place music , and short 2 second close up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for . and i don't mind at all . i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers an excellent book , in my opinion , not so hot a movie but that's another review . after looking it up on imdb , my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career see bond girl and wild things references here . they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r rated status coveted in suspense video rental sections , that is . in any event , they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense softcore porn section . all in all , it's entertaining . i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a tv pilot , though . that was the biggest pull while watching it when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show , the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual . would i rent it again ? no . would i watch this tv show ? well , why not it's better than baywatch . and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s . token black guy who's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter racial dating , token asian japanese , i assume from the name koji more adept at science and computers than talking to women , beautiful , intelligent latina pre med student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account this show probably would have done ok . but as a movie it just cracks me . i gave it a 7 out of 10 , considering what it was and what it was forced to become . it made for a very enjoyable evening , and that's all i ask of rentals .",1,0
"without kirsten miller this project needn't have been completed . however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it . it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance . wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing , but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained . mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line , the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster . the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable . she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be . i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost .",1,0
"i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie . for instance , the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could hollywood just throw in a token gay character in the movie . and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great . one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top . and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters . for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible . but i guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad . but if you're more open minded and i don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film .",1,0
"jack frost 2 , is probably the most cheesiest movie i have ever seen in my life . the complete title of the film , is jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman . horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines , will be delighted to watch this . this film was straight to video , and for good reasons . here's why the acting , was so atrocious , and so terrible , that it could cause one to cry . the main character had no personality , and the actor's bad acting made it all worse . the screenplay was , was also atrocious . each character always says a cheesy line , and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography , then you have something bad . second , the story line isn't really all that impressive , but since this movie was straight to video , it is forgiven . the director , and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman , into something cool , but they didn't . they story has lots of plot holes in it . in the beginning , a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank , with the melted jack frost . scientists try to restore his life , but they couldn't . once the cup of coffee fell into the tank , jack frost was completely restored . now he is immune to anti freeze . in jack frost part 1 , the main character's dna got mixed up with the anti freeze that was used to kill jack frost . since the main character is allergic to bananas , jack frost is too . hence , here's my point . they say that sam's dna combined with jack frost's . but , one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup , so when it fell into the tank , the scientists dna would have been combined with jack frosts . another thing , the special effects weren't very good either . here's the good points jack frost 2 has lots of blood , that looks pretty realistic . even though this movie is flawed to hell , it is still entertaining . overall , jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie . the first one was better though . 7 out of 10 .",1,0

"four teenage girlfriends drive to fort laurdale for spring break . unfortunately they get a flat tire in medley , georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods . the local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins . shallow grave is a pleasant low budget surprise . the cast is likable enough , the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic . especially the second murder is pretty grim . the murderous sheriff isn't one dimensional character in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he's done . the subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere , but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting . 7 out of 10 .",1,0

"chokher bali was shown at the washington dc filmfest april 15 , 2005 . the director , rituparno ghosh , was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards . as always , i think aishwarya did a fantastic job . i can understand those who think she should be been more aggressive or more bitchy , but would that really be realistic in 1904 ? possible , maybe ; realistic , i'm not so sure . i think her interpretation was valid , although there could certainly be other ways to do it . i hate to use the word , but this was the most inaccessible of the indian movies i have seen so far . i know a fair amount of indian history , hindu religion , etc . , but the level of detail here was far beyond me . clearly you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were intimately familiar with hinduism and its customs , esp . as they were c . 1904 . i missed a lot of things one of them being the fact that the mother in law would want binodini in the house as sort of a counter weight to her daughter in law ashalata . spoilers ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie much better for me . first , the original bengali version was 20 minutes longer . so what was left out ? apparently three main things a beginning segment where binodini aishwarya leaves e . bengal for calcutta . according to the director , different characters are speaking w . bengali vs . e . bengali setting up some of the political comments later . of course all of this is lost in the hindi version , and certainly to a non indian like me , it wouldn't have mattered anyway but a set up of the bengali situation sure would have . next , there was a segment where binodini was writing a poem a sign of her independence , etc . finally , some more business about the jewellery . so , although some people think it was too long , i think the original , longer version would have been clearer . the women's hair was apparently another sign ghosh again the mother in law had short hair short hair for hindu widows , her sister also a widow had longer hair more modern ! , and of course binodini aishwarya had extremely long waist length hair rejection of status of widowhood . the ending really threw me all of a sudden binodini , who had never had a political thought , is writing a political manifesto ? whoa ! ghosh explained that he was in locarno , at a film festival , when the subtitles were done . the subtitles use the word country throughout binodini's letter . gosh said a more appropriate word would have been i forget his exact word something like self or independence she was talking about her own liberation and finding herself not about bengal , india , and the british . so why does binodini just disappear the day after finding behari again ? apparently because during her stay on the ganges she realizes that she doesn't need a man any man to define complete her . she can just be herself . so she rejects behari , who she threw herself at a few months ? before , and just goes off . of course i'm not sure how she buys her next meal , but that's another question . the red shawl ghosh again she buys represents revolution as well as passion . i'm not 100 sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman , but perhaps she is rejecting passion revolution ? the binoculars , which binodini uses throughout the movie to watch mahendra and ashalata , the boat on the ganges , etc . . she is being a voyeur to see a life she yearns for but can't have . at the end i missed this ! she leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter , showing that she doesn't need them any more she's going off to lead her own life . finally , the tagore quote at the beginning saying how he apologized for the ending . apparently tagore wrote this as a serial , hooking his readers with the sexy widow bits . but at the end he sold out to conservatism and had binodini kneel down at the feet of mahendra and behari , begging their forgiveness . one of his students ? wrote to tagore taking him to task for his sell out ending . and tagore replied with his apology for the ending . in the movie , of course , ghosh goes in the other direction .",1,0
"tia carrere was the reason i decided to watch this film , as neither the title , nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film which goes to show , me and everyone , that a dvd shouldn't be judged by it's cover . spoilers the film felt like it was trundling along , not really going anywhere for the moment the awkwardness of paul faber zak orth around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch , and the fringe on the otherwise attractive kirsten beck as alexondra lee being too school girlish to watch . where those really fashionable in 1995 ? the relationship between vicky mueller tia carrere and todd boomer jason london was tantalising from the start of though ! that first meeting across the lake magical . what a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as he has behaved like a complete moron boomer , with two o's as in moron in front of alexondra . a shame really that we as the audience knew who vicky mueller really was . well the title did give that away , wouldn't you think ? what really surprised me was the acting . especially in the scene where vicky gives todd a metal version of his alter ego the dog character , in the little white jewellery box . the actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss point of no return for todd and vicky . a shame really that the film ends with focus on after getting over todd's fathers harvard drive his re uniting with his friends . i could envision a whole new film following vicky to new york there must be a good art university there that todd could attend ? ! ? nevertheless , a film that does just what we want hollywood to entertain us for the duration of the film . did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film ? todd's mother is slightly insane on the phone 24 7 , his dad doesn't find her attractive any more ? todd's teacher obviously is disenchanted by his wife and vice versa todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic daring relationship which , however nice it may be , would realistically be very difficult to maintain age difference , maturity difference etc , and alexondra zak do not get together because alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship her reactions towards the condom , the cheating , zak's advances etc . are all very immature , and often involve running away , and zak himself , the poor guy is too much of a best friend like a brother guy to pull even alexondra . mind you , good film though ! i gave it an 8 10 . brilliant performance by the actors who bring the script to life .",1,0
"okay . yes , this was a very tight budget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together , and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt out part , and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles . but come on . richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip . steven ford was very likable . mancuso had some great lines , while nancy allen , ironically , was completely bland and uninteresting . classic ? no . bad parts ? yes . entertaining ? big yes . i would have loved to have been on set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have . are you fast ? . y'ain't that fast .",1,0

"nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie flicks , but honestly why would we bother ? every single film in the zombi series delivers great fun , nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and zombi 3 is no exception to this , despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting . this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project , who had to elaborate further on his zombi 2 success , but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films . the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity , every ingenious idea from george a . romero's night of the living dead and the crazies is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at . yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over the top gore compensates for everything ! on a secret army base at the phillipines , scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus death one and prepare it for transport . after a failing attempt to steal the virus , the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village . the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area . this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's nightmare city . truly bad . but incredibly entertaining with fast paced action sequences and several very creative zombie madness situations . the undead birds were original , for example , and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well . the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick . recommended to the fans ; don't mind the negative reviews .",1,0

"first , nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly . not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ghost trains as a child . second , the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future . third , this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes , eva mendezes , and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb lights are . mrs . christian is not a light , but a sun . however , dark remains is also of considerable metaphysical importance . they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and imagination that are not visible with one' own eyes is not new . but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times . this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign , but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the real reality can . being a sign , the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects , i . e . the sign behaves like an object . now , in our usual world of perception , it is common that objects change signs . f . ex . , if someone grows a bird , his photograph will show him with beard , not without , as it did before . but the opposite , the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man . this is , very simply expressed , the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison , in this movie . this is new , and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well known , mostly since the silent time .",1,0
"as far as i know , this show was never repeated on uk television after its original run in the late '60s early '70s , and most episodes are now sadly missing presumed wiped . series 6 from 1971 however still exists in its entirety , and i recently got the chance to watch it all , the best part of 4 decades on . after rushing home from school , freewheelers was essential viewing for me and many of my contemporaries back in those halcyon days of flared trousers , slade and chicory tip . and watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat . never mind the bad hammy acting , the unintentionally amusing fight scenes , plot holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean going yacht through and the frightfully , frightfully rada accents of the lead players . no forget all that . because freewheelers harks back to a bygone dare i say golden age of kids' tv drama , when the shows were simply about rip roaring fun and didn't take themselves so seriously . before they became obsessed with all the angst laden ishoos that today's screenwriters have their young protagonists fret over , such as relationships , pregnancy , drugs , stis etc . no doubt if it were remade for a modern audience in these days of all pervasive political correctness , the boss figure would be a black female , one of the young male heroes would be a muslim , the other would be a white lad confused about his sexuality and the girl would be an all action go getter with an iq off the scale , who'd be forever getting the lads out of scrapes and making them look foolish in other words a million miles removed from wendy padbury's deferential , ankle spraining washer upper . it's a show that's very much of its time . but is that a bad thing ? i for one don't think so .",1,0

"the 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun . sometimes , there were some definite brains behind it all evil dead ii , night of the creeps and return of the living dead for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends . movies like pieces and blood diner stacked rental shelves in the 80's and 90's , offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment . kevin tenney's 1988 movie night of the demons is a part of this tradition stupid , poorly acted and not an original bone in it's body , but dammit if you don't have a good time . the plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80's a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20's decide to go to a party at hull house thrown by angela mimi kinkade and suzanne scream queen legend linnea quigley . well , angela and co . decide to throw a s ance . this turns out to be as will arnett's arrested development character gob would call it , a huge mistake , because a demonic force soon possesses angela , and starts to get to the others as well . take the evil dead , a nightmare on elm street and your average dumb dead teen flick , throw them in a blender , and night of the demons is what you get . the movie is anything but original , and really , it's not a good movie . the whole thing is insanely derivative , the acting is terrible , the jokes often fall flat , the characters are annoying especially the character of stooge and the plot holes are numerous . that out of the way , it's still a lot of fun . so why ? well for one thing , the make up and gore effects are top notch , with some really memorable moments especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick that really stick out . it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously , yet with the exception of some terrible puns , plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness . plus , there's a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that's almost impossible to resist . yeah , it's nothing special , but it knows that , and it couldn't be more proud of that fact . it's a goofy party horror movie , and it never pretends to be anything more . it might not be a classic , but night of the demons is a good example of horror junk food done right . it might not be too memorable or original , but sometimes you don't want a fancy beer . sometimes you want a budweiser .",1,0
"toy soldiers is an okay action movie but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the scriptwriters and director put into portraying american counter terrorist forces accurately . just check out the end credits there are more than a dozen us military officers and officials listed . the movie accurately portrays the fbi as having control of the hostage situation but turning it over the us army's delta force who are unnamed in the movie as the pentagon was still denying their existence at this time once the president waived the posse commitatus act of us code . the us army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time . and even the use of an ah 64 apache for air support which might seem a bit over the top , is not terribly unrealistic . far more expensive and frankly better movies have portrayed american counter terrorist forces with far less accuracy .",1,0
"i think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car to get stripped deserves whatever happens to them . the guy , wade who went to a barbershop and asked for the he man haircut wasn't my type , but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed . that's a little too high maintenance for me . also fun , but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks like elton john only gayer , but that whole plot goes nowhere ! blake was hot , i could see myself with him if he wasn't so into his girlfriend , who is a phony paris hilton in a bad wig no chihuahaua in her handbag , though but that would have been really precious . i don't think girls who look like that go to football games anyways . nick the car thief is the sexiest ! one of the best parts is where a football lands by him , and instead of throwing it back , he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football . see , that's just the kind of guy he is . he has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wife beater . her bra straps are showing for , like 1 2 the movie ! mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this .",1,0
"movie about two australian girls debbie nell schofield and sue sue knight and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys . i caught this at an art cinema here in america in 1981 . technically i was still a teenager i was 19 so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted . script wise there's nothing new here . it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating , sex , suicide etc etc . i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored . what i found interesting was , despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair , these teenagers aren't much different than american teens . they had many of the same difficulties and hang ups . also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and i heard it was a faithful adaptation of it . the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was well made and pretty interesting . so this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids . i give it a 7 .",1,0
"when you start watching this animation masterpiece , you quickly notice , that it's a european production . although the europeans have sadly integrated some of the clich s you would normally find in an american production of this kind , most are missing . one of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our very few and very unlikely heroes can vanquish . another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money , is greedy , runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature . this movie would have been better off without both . the movie is based upon a tv series that was out four years before the movie . unlike the movie , the tv series is a cartoon and not a computer animation . at first i thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but i was quickliy convinced whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff ! although the characters are obviously fictional in stills they don't even look real , they seem as alive and sentient as the audience following their quest . making characters who by normal standards could be considered deformed those micro legs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump so alive and lovable is more than just a highlight ! the creation of the world is another masterpiece . not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it . the world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air . when a person steps on a smaller fragment of ground , it nods a little bit as if feathering from the weight . in some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere . although the world of floating islands is completely surreal , in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it doesn't seem any weirder than running into a car somewhere in new york . i wrote that the looks of the world aren't as breathtaking as the idea . as true as that might be to my mind , the quality of the world , the characters and the attention to details is staggering . although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes , emotions can be read as clearly as in sean connery's or dustin hoffman's face . the world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike . the background is always in motion , something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive . if you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can find . the existence of hector actually puts the cherry on top . hector is a furry little thing possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world who is totally lovable and extremely funny . although he isn't really important for the main plot , he would be missed like scrat would be in ice age . the really cool thing about hector is that you need to speak gibberish to understand him . if the movie is so great , why didn't i give it 10 stars ? well , the plot in itself was rather thin . two hunters are sent out to rescue the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world , isn't really original . that in itself wouldn't be much of a problem . what i missed was the background information . what kind of a dragon was this and why did it look that way ? i love mythical stories but if they get too thin then they seem to be written after the movie is finished in a feeble attempt to give the whole thing some depth . another thing i didn't like was zo . although a little girl like her could be considered adorable , she was somewhat of a pain in this movie . she seemed pretty resistant to all types of learning about reality , kept dreaming of some hero from a story book and basically slowed the others down . she would have been ok if she had developed a little more and a little earlier in the movie or had been less of a girly to start with . to me the idea of this girl who was there to twist the story a little backfired on the writers . all in all , this is a really good movie for just about all ages .",1,0

"spoilers ahead it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be such a disappointment . i thought this was full of silly clich s and that it basically tried to hard . to the american guys out there how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds ? to the married girls how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight but not with your husband ? to the french would you really ask about someone being la fac when you know they don't speak french ? wouldn't you use a more common word like universit ? i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understand europe and i love it , but my german roommate and i found this pretty insulting overall . it looked like a movie funded by the european parliament , and it tried too hard basically . it had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together not a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward , but in fact ridiculous too many clashes that wouldn't really happen . then the end of the movie the last 10 minutes ruined all the rest . why doesn't xavier talk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris ? why does he just walk off ? why does he just run away from his job , is that freedom ? and in the end , is the new europe supposed to rest on a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day ? is this what it's made up of ? besides , the acting was pretty horrible . i can't believe judith godr che's role and acting . why was she made to look like emanuelle b art so much ? at first i thought xavier was ok but with retrospect i think he was pretty bad . and that's all really too bad , because technically opening credits , scenes when he's asking what papers he needs it was really good except for sound editing around the british siblings , and the soundtrack was great too . so the form was good , but the content pretty horrible .",1,0

"i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this movie . other than the mother being a complete moron on a few occasions and the youngest daughter being idiotic enough to go out at night , into woods that scared her in the daytime , this movie was pretty good . had the director had the sense to treat us as if we had brains , maybe he'd have given us a movie where the people didn't have to behave idiotically , but still manage to get into danger . it worked for the plumber and the fellow in the trailer , but apparently the teenagers and the mother needed to be idiots , for the director to get closure in ending this film . atmosphere was great , scenery was awesome and the undead kids scared the crap out of me . i live in a wooded area , so taking out the trash will creep me out for quite a while . the movie works for me accept for what i already mentioned . raise the mom's iq a bit and i'd give it a ten .",1,0

"the history of tv to film adaptations are littered with aberrations which almost conclusively prove that the tradition should never have started in the first place . there are , however , some examples which manage to pull it off , just . rising damp would , at first , appear to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment as this hilarious series was based within the tiny confines of a northern bedsit . also the writer , eric chappell , wasn't being paid enough to spend time crafting an entirely original screenplay so he harvested a batch of tv episodes and stitched them together to form the body of the film . this , in itself , didn't necessarily mean that the script would fail . david croft and jimmy perry did the same thing with their screenplay for dad's army and it worked superbly . although , the early dad's army episodes , with their staid pace and over arcing plot , lent themselves far better to film adaptation . the rising damp episodes , however , were high energy affairs from the first scene to the breathless climax . as a result , as one story is concluded and another started , the scenes within the film become disjointed . another pitfall for the movie version of a tv series is the inevitable comparisons that are made . in this respect the film pales in comparison to rising damp's brilliant series . despite all this , rising damp the movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally uproarious . it is perhaps not surprising that the finest moments occur during sequences written specially for the film . this includes a rugby match where rossiter does a brilliantly timed pratfall . indeed , while all the cast handle their roles perfectly bar a sub standard replacement actor for the late and truly great beckinsale , it is leonard rossiter as rigsby that shines the most . in fact rising damp should have been made as a film just so rossiter could have been eligible for an oscar , such is the magnificence of his acting talent . criminally , he wasn't even nominated . ultimately , the film fails to match the giddy heights of the tv series while managing to hold its own as a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments . recommended viewing . one last thing the opening and closing music is by far the worst in film history .",1,0

"some spoilers included although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly here . to quote from encyclopedia britannica's , surreal means fantastic or incongruous imagery one needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten year old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red mustang could be fantastic those curious might read james kincaid ; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car , he'd surely protest , no way ! what fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes . thereafter we get more iterations of the same , in an ever cruder and more squalid progression that , far from incongruous , soon proves predictable . not that it were , on the other hand , literally believable but it were unfair to tax motorama in particular with this flaw , any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical film maker's and viewer's scale of values ever since raiders of the lost ark became a blockbuster . hallucinatory how do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one ? at any rate , some people know that they enjoy hallucinogenic drugs but if motorama typifies the result of doing so , then i'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once . there is , of course , the occasional bad trip . the movie must be one of those , pun and all . juxtaposition of words that was startling how many times can a ten year old startle you by uttering oh , my god ! when he likes something , or damn ! when he doesn't ? these two interjections are about par for the course with this script . sadly , any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal , in direct proportion , one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising american generation . a world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense motorama's world indeed makes no sense , but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper . the numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims damn ! in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie . and even his character , despite appearing in nearly every scene , gets no significant development . here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes , as i must , enough to wish to know him better and understand 'where he's coming from . ' one vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out . fully recognizable , realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous , paradoxical , or shocking framework . no , we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more dilapidated billboards , filling stations , greasy spoon eateries , cheap hotels , and their lowlife habitues along country highways , exactly where they stereotypically belong . largely responsible for perpetuating . the traditional emphasis on content . there is little content , moment to moment , in motorama . to sum up picture british millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party , sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their rolls royces like fragile skiffs through a roiling sea of desperate humanity , chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood . or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques , limousines like those above now rusting , and white pianos tinkled by ghosts . into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an ailing woman to whom he clings as mother figure becoming girl friend , who fall asleep side by side on the grass . he is awakened on the feast of the transfiguration , white and glistering day 1945 by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun . finding that his consort has become a corpse , he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven . later he explains only a little less innocently , 'i learned a new word today atom bomb . it's like god taking a photograph . ' now , there are just two samples of cinematic surrealism , surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title empire of the sun . if you seek surreal , please don't miss it . alas , however hard he treads on the accelerator to race his chariot through and beyond the desert , no scenes so exquisitely strange , rich , subtle , or gorgeous await motorama's poor little gus in his quest . none of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs down on this film . though somewhat disappointed , i can't dismiss it , in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify one influenced , to be sure , by surrealism , but also by expressionism , existentialism , and franz kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures . let's try on for size theater of the absurd . turning to e . b . 's article on this style , i am amazed by how , to the extent that theater of the absurd is a valid artistic style , the above objections to motorama vanish like a puff of smoke . i'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification . theater of the absurd attempts to show that the human situation is essentially absurd , devoid of purpose . humankind is left feeling hopeless , bewildered , and anxious . having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents , gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading motorama and decides to win the lottery that it promises . as others have already revealed , this ambition proves illusory although the game never expires , the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win , and has ways to trick , confuse , and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward . he , like others , is ultimately disappointed in his dream . absurdist playwrights , therefore , did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre . there is little dramatic action as conventionally understood ; however frantically the characters perform , their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence . a timeless , circular quality emerges . language in an absurdist play is full of . repetitions . repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense . underneath a sometimes dazzling comic surface , we find an underlying message of metaphysical distress . gus's obsession with a silly game , his inane language , the plot device wherein he divines a bleak future and or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn so much fits now . while an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films , anyway , of spielberg , admirers of motorama as it really is should find fellow travelers not instead but addition in the works of beckett , ionesco , and genet . but one can't quite stop here . after his disillusionment with the game , gus returns to phil i . e . , love , the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him decently , although he had also scolded him at a service station advertising be full filled ! . under phil's tutelage he learns a life of waiting for cars . we might note here that the absurdist playwright beckett had entitled his most famous play waiting for godot , and that for godot we should read god . god is one of phil's preoccupations , too . furthermore , as the indirect result of his previous encounter with gus , phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out horizontally . in the last scene , gus , now phil's protege , says that he wants to hear music . we hear none , but we see phil wiggling his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm , beckoning gus closer , and gus responds . the end . finally , on to an author whom i happen to be reading currently , the anglican theologian william stringfellow . if this rebel lawyer is not acknowledged as an architect or undergirder of liberation theology , which is more a roman catholic than an anglican movement , perhaps he should be . police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature , including motorama , but stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture , tradition , and reason . his most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the bible refers to as principalities and powers . principalities , wrote stringfellow , are behind all of our popular three i's images , institutions , and ideologies . all of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises . the more deeply involved with an image , an institution , or an ideology any person becomes , the more his own personhood becomes depleted and be becomes a slave to them . promising power , control , and immortality , they inexorably deliver helplessness , chaos , and death . as essentially fallen , defeated powers , they can do no more than that . yet they beguile humans with that dominion over the earth promised by god in the book of genesis , while in fact no one of us controls an image , an institution , or an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and self preservation . they take on lives of their own . dominion happens to be a mistranslation a more accurate rendering of the hebrew would be stewardship . but this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem most of us neglect to notice that god had delegated this power to adam before the fall . we have no reason to assume that we , his descendents , still exercise it now on the contrary , it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us . one might add two observations of c . s . lewis first , that man's conquest of nature is a mere illusion , and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument ; and secondly , contrary to popular belief , satan is no kind of good time charlie . he may dangle out pleasures at first , but he is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in his thrall , perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment . now , applying these insights to motorama , we seem them mirrored remarkably in gus's experience . he is , if not nice , at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the motorama game . the first signs advertising it glisten glamorously . the longer he continues , however , and the deeper he journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters , the more shabby they become . he's lonely , meeting no one else who plays the game . the stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are staffed by zombies . the people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly , deceitful , and hostile . the fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another . gus's humanity is leached out of him as he becomes not only totally self centered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded . disfigured . prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged . eventually even his precious mustang is taken from him in a crash , and he must continue in a dead man's wreck . yet at long last , having done everything he thought was expected , he presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive his prize . using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity , its agents evade him , disappoint , insult , and finally throw him from the top floor . he falls long and hard , landing , finally in a body of water . in other words , in classic symbolism , he dies . he has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiver . but this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future . he repents and returns to phil , and upon seeing him performs the very first generous , selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half noting that phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a hose into a gas tank , he asks , can i help you with that ? then , seeing the help wanted sign , he decides to apply for the job , explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitch hiking that he reckons he'll get out here , because it doesn't look like too bad a place to work . this interpretation is conjectural , of course , and it may surprise or even outrage the film's cult classic aficionados who see quite different points in it . if motorama isn't quite my cup of tea , i'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film ever made .",1,0
"i came out of rendition with a list of flaws a mile long , so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie ? it's definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts . those parts include a cast of big name stars , not one of them giving a memorable performance omar metwally , a relative unknown , is the one you'll remember ; serviceable if undistinguished direction ; and a screenplay that's both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time . metwally is an egyptian born american citizen who gets kidnapped by the u . s . government's rendition program , otherwise known as the process by which america tortures suspected terrorists into confessing information whether or not it's remotely true . reese witherspoon plays his pregnant wife , who calls in the favor of an old college friend peter saarsgard , who works for a senator alan arkin and helps to track her husband down . meryl streep plays the head of the rendition program ; jake gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way . meanwhile , a whole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top egyptian official who is allied to the american rendition program and her boyfriend , who's in training to become a suicide bomber . ay yi yi that's a lot of plot to pack into a two hour movie , and i was about to wash my hands of the whole thing , especially the egyptian romeo and juliet subplot that felt like nothing more than a distraction . but then near the film's finale , a twist of chronology brings all of the plot strands together in a way that makes you want to reassess everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters , and makes rendition a much more interesting movie than it seems like it's going to be . witherspoon , gyllenhaal and sarsgaard all look like high school students playing adults twenty years older than they actually are gyllenhaal in particular , usually a fine actor , looks so bored that you wonder if he's going to muster the energy to deliver his lines . and the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as good as meryl streep at his disposal and giving her nothing more to work with than this one dimensional dragon lady . the movie of course strives for relevancy , but instead of addressing the tangled web of arguments surrounding the national security issue , it charges right down the middle of the debate in a predictable fashion . there are moments when you think maybe the film will veer off in an interesting direction what if witherspoon did actually begin to doubt her husband's past , for instance ? what if metwally actually had been in contact with terrorists , as his interrogators accuse ? but no , the movie takes the path of least resistance . but , like i said upfront , i recommend this movie . i know i've done nothing but list a bunch of its faults , but it's got its head in the right place , and it is entertaining , or at least as as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can be . grade b",1,0
"i forsee many students now signing up for student exchange to barcelona and being disappointed when they don't have quite such an exciting time . the movie was enjoyable . it's of course always a pleasure to see audrey tatou . however , i have a very strong issue with part of the movie . the lesbian roommate tells xavier that women like to be physically dominated which i take issue with and shows him some sort of butt grabbing move that's guaranteed to get a woman . xavier then tries out the butt grab on a shy married friend who starts out saying no no i'm married , i'm married but then somehow succumbs to the butt grab ? all of a sudden she's moaning yes yes and they're going at it on the benches in parc guell . i found this really really offensive . furthermore it is very stereotyped . how often have we seen scenes where the woman says no but obviously doesn't mean it ? no means no . grabbing butts physical domination isn't going to make it right . it just totally supported the stereotypical rape myths . i wasn't even sure how to read the next scene where he gloats to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time he was just going to demand suck it , slut or something like that . did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to go ? this section really ruined the movie for me .",1,0

"here's what i knew about atlantis before watching it it's officially disney's first animated sci fi adventure . i'm not sure how accurate that is i like to nitpick but it made me curious first time i heard it described . the preview looked , for the most part , damn cool . evidently , it was also too cryptic according to some critics after the fact . it apparently did so badly that disney said , screw it , let's re release 'spy kids' . so , with all that said , how is the movie ? hella cool . i'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway , but atlantis goes all out . it's a throwback to all the cgi eye candy shots in beauty and the beast and aladdin , so much so that it's almost an effects animator's best of show . the characters maybe aren't that memorable except , perhaps , for the ship's medical officer , and the plot's a little dull , but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot . here's a controversy that bothers me . the failure as in , it only took in , like , five hundred million or something ; i know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc . has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation . i don't think that's true . how do you account for the south park movie ? what about final fantasy ? really , the story and the artistry is everything , not the method . i don't know what disney's comeback movie will be like , but i don't think they're out of the picture yet .",1,0

"joseph conrad's timeless novel , heart of darkness , was depicted in the 1994 movie . i have read conrad's novel , and i must say , even though i prefer the novel itself , the movie was a great depiction . the set and costume designs brought conrad's novel to life on the screen as we followed marlow's journey . the acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms , voices , and personalities . if you have read the novel , i recommend that you also view this movie . if you have not read the novel , however , the movie may be harder to follow . conrad's heart of darkness is too full of action , emotion , and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long . therefore , if you have not read the novel , the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow . overall i gave this movie a seven out of ten . the basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets , costumes , and acting . nothing can replace joseph conrad's original work however .",1,0

"i'm a petty officer 1st class e 6 and have been in the uscg for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard . there were only a few scenes that were far fetched . the most far fetched was when po fischer kutcher went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room . that would never happen . swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances . second , the command center supposedly in kodiak , it looked more like a nasa command center . we don't have any gear that hi tech . third , the captain of the airstation would not be running the search rescue cases with like 10 people on watch . in reality it would be an e 6 or e 7 as the sar controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist sar controller a radio watchstander . otherwise the movie was dead on , i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search rescue instead of just aviation based rates . some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days .",1,0

"i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago . i enjoyed the film at that time , so i was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since . perhaps it's my memory , but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival . i'm really not sure which version i prefer , but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both . let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie . although it's been promoted as a hammer films tribute , people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed . there's some cleavage , but no nudity a staple of the british production house's later movies . and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film , and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt , it's not like any of the company's pictures in tone or execution . this film is very dark , very confusing , and at times very funny . i don't remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one , but that's not a bad thing especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short . and some of ms pitt's rantings are quite entertaining . it's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose . the uniqueness of this film doesn't lie with the borrowed details , though . it's in the ideas . as an occasional sci fi channel viewer , i've regularly taken the network to task for its one note variations on a theme cgi monster kills , then gets destroyed . sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while . but don't get me wrong . i'm not complaining . if anything , i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising low budget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts . it's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are . but for the rest of us , those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films , the predictability , the lack of respect for the audience , this may just be your ticket .",1,0

"to fight against the death penalty is a just cause . everyone who is sane in europe would think so . in the usa everything is different . the film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving american justice . a young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case . but the film has a sequel . justice in the usa is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance . miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance . one person in the local public attorney offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges . this public attorney's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free . but he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire . he hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance . but he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls . he apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys . one day the local cops follow their intuition , guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl , and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of . they beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and russian roulette . he confesses . sent to death row , he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in massachusetts who is the husband of the local public attorney's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails . it will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice , police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality , some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance . to charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice . the best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention , just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence , which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial , hence easily discardable , with a good lawyer . the film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don't want to make a mistake , which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief americans are supposed to have we hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . declaration of independence life is an unalienable right that was given to man by his creator , which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away . only god can take the life of a person away . the death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have . even if we do not evoke god , we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance , and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace . if vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty . and there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of happiness but of vengeance . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne , university paris 8 saint denis , university paris 12 cr teil , cegid",1,0
"take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail . they're not the faces of hollywood extras . somebody in production was really smart to take filming to oxford , mississippi , because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot . scope out the narrow dusty roads , the frozen earth beneath , and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on . no wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving ; they're just reflecting the soil from which they spring . old man lucas hernandez better fear for his life , but then he springs from that same hard earth . the movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes and even has some suspense . old man lucas is not very likable . he's a victim and we sympathize , but he's also haughty and unfriendly . wisely , the script refuses to sweeten him up . that way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic . the script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective . instead , we're shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death . so , it's through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed , a much more effective pathway . it also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the jim crow system . note how the movie doesn't attack segregation . it's doubtful that old man lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there's no hint that even lawyer stevens brian wants to cross the color line except to see justice done . no , the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid jarman whose head is not yet filled with notions . he's not exactly friends with lucas , but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek . the last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle , the lawyer , instead of his more hidebound parents the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked . the lawyer might not join a future civil rights march , but the kid might . that's the movie's realistically hopeful side . there was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief 3 year period , 1949 51 , the well , no way out , home of the brave , lost boundaries . even famously detached mgm got into the mix with this little gem . unfortunately , the mccarthy purges in hollywood put an end to problem films that might not serve cold war ends . even so , each of these is worth catching up with , not only because they're good movies , but because even with the passage of 60 years and jim crow , they're still relevant .",1,0

"i had a personal interest in this movie . when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union . at the end of my first day sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc . for one or two weeks . when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego . just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn . once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton , the big marine base . there , on the beach , we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base . it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation , which included a water tank , gun entrenchments , sand bagged trenches and living quarters . all this was at very high pay , sometimes 'golden time' , which was triple our regular hourly wage . our food was also first rate prime rib at lunch , etc . which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home . once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out , which was about eight or ten months later . then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen . then it was no more than three or four minutes maybe less of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens . a bit disappointing , but still fun . in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since . i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis , which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there . bob weverka",1,0

"the whole movie made me think of the first circle of dante's inferno , where the souls who 'fool' themselves in believing that they are happy go to . they never realize they are actually in an inferno , but nothing is enjoyable , they just move on without any emotion . in that sense dante thought that they the were in the worse part , as they would never actively try to change their situation . nobody can die in that place , but trying to certainly does hurt . i am not sure if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not , but the resemblance is absolutely striking . i didn't enjoy the movie when i was watching it , as i was expecting a climax which never came . nevertheless , it made me think afterwards and now i actually think it's a good film it surely does stick .",1,0

"this movie is more lupin then most , especially coming from funimation . other then the bad dub , it isn't bad . the first hour is a lot like the comic which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on . lupin's trying to get a huge treasure . fujiko's using lupin's weakness to women to try to get something out of it . the last bit isn't that bad , he's with another women , but of course fujiko's still him number one . a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin . any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie . it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits they make it a little mushy but overall , it isn't a bad film . good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the lupin iii movies .",1,0

"the story is extremely unique . it's about these 2 pilots saving earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly . the whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time , friends , and mentors . the ending could have been fantastic . it started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy disney note and annoyed me very bad . the animation is decent for 89 but can't compare to nowadays . i have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity . i actually found it to be somewhat decent . the nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess . overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic .",1,0

"anyone that is looking for an episode of law and order or csi would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case . a murder took place , and all the police did was to grab a 15 year old boy off the street and take him to the only witness a 65 year old man and say is this the guy who did it ? sure , the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty . never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently . he must have shrunk , reversed his age by 5 10 years and changed clothes . the police made absolutely no effort and they admitted it ! the did no forensics on any of the evidence , they questioned no other witnesses , and they beat a confession out of a 15 year old . the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in jacksonville , florida . let everyone now start talking about southern justice .",1,0

"what more could i say ? the americans totally hated it because the u . s . cut was so bad , although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it . talking about the u . s . theatrical release along with the newly released blu ray disc version , it's faster and tighter than hk cut , the background musics were all changed from the dark , grim hk musics to hip hop musics ; and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out . though , the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor's voice and tone . but , the problem is hak hap black mask the movie was designed and meant to be dark , grim , super disturbing and totally gruesome . very unfortunately the u . s . release just skimmed the cream they wanted , which in return completely changed the movie's undertone hk release was rated 18 to be even more comical and amateurish . now let's talk about the original hk release . this movie is like a hidden gem , a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era . the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit old school among hk movies . however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture . with all the leather , black costumes and decorations , this movie features a batman like superhero in a black mask against a run of the mill gang of multinational super soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss . yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child , but it works . it's so impressive that the whole movie's gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats . in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg 13 rating , but without jet li and liu qing yun . and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship . and , did i happen to mention francois yip ? her roundhouse kick was totally cool , even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting . did i mention she was also smoking hot ? anyway , there are a lot of things to like about the movie . however , the movie also suffered from a lot of problems . first off , it's a mediocre script made at its best potential , which means this production team deserved a better screen writer . there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences us version was even worse because all the character developments were cut . anyway , you can't ask too much out of a comic inspired action movie . also , this movie is entirely improper for children . i won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old . it's saturated with disturbing contents including blood , gore , sado maso costumes , extreme brutal violence and so on . along with the style of the movie , it can be called a wet dream for heavy metal rock music fans and action fans . the u . s . cut was milder , but if you want to see it , see the hk release for what it is . 7 10 . status inspiring , hidden , undervalued , adult .",1,0

"beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature . forbidden lie 2007 is simply a better cinematic version of norma khouri's book forbidden love , and that was a best seller . an onion peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman , lie is the very best in editorialised reality tv . cleverly edited and colourful , broinowski's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of norma khouri meaningfully blowing smoke . i disagree with variety that it's overlong ; instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others' just recorded testimonials . on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired . so i watched it twice . this oscar worthy effort is at once genuinely funny , upsetting , and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another . the apparent con unfolded in the australian state of queensland via very personal swindles of khouri's friends and fans ! . clearly these friends are now turned , the funniest on camera line belonging to khouri's qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat , no nonsense colloquialisms i think it's a load of sh ! t . personally . we need to learn from their experience , hence my belief in spoilers . any perennial lie spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie . there's some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian , who instead presses her con artist repeatedly for corroboration . since being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication , khouri has been on the run , but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name . she absconded supposedly because a she's either terrified of her sly , more italian sounding than greek husband , or b because she needed her passport visas to clear her name . unlikely . a more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas one guess no , not jordan . according to a closing card , khouri is still under investigation by the fbi in 2007 . i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge . instead , the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen . once they caught on , there was plenty counter derision and catcalls ; earlier , stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didn't know how to take khouri's evolving contradictions . the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end , not leaving anything out not even her own self sacrifice . anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself . the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first key to how a lifelong liar operates in half truths . khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr old with rather disarming charm , and surprisingly , worked out biceps . gradually we're introduced to less and less adulating aussie journos , publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouri's honour killing accusations hook , line and sinker . later we see their more rueful reactions , quite self controlled and matter of fact , if some perhaps a little bitter . it was jordanian anti honour killing activists who took deepest umbrage at khouri's fallacies because its pot stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change . honour killings do happen in jordan ; it's just their prevalence that's at odds with khouri's book plus 72 other facts . in 2003 these activists faxed australian random house with 73 painstakingly checked objections . the publishing houses across 4 continents who'd jumped at the chance to publish first time author khouri never tried to check any facts . leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract , they too were fair game . so a massive hot topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafes . later still we're shocked to discover that the factual errors extend to khouri's bio as well . for one thing , she's not only not a 35yr old virgin her defence is that she merely didn't disabuse people of their assumptions , but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers ! sometimes she's just too fast talking in her american accent . she also seems too comfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes . i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who don't need any western paternalism from me , but when even cultural cues don't jibe in addition to khouri's facts , you've got to start questioning your source . at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion . she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account , in person , in jordan . the last third is consumed with a fact finding trip back to amman , where one fact after another falls . eventually broinowski forces her con artist to admit the decade discrepancy in her story , and it's after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera . secret , because in it khouri's american security guard jeremy is heard to have an australian accent he's an actor !

"i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it . what's great about it is the atmosphere , the music , the location , the cinematography and the beautiful cast . the story is non existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter . the pace in languid and the settings are exotic . the film has a lot going for it . unfortunately , it also has a few things going against it . the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever . because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability . according to imdb , al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie . they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen . the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous . there's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i've ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross dresser ! the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend ! and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter , in mid air . and al cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera ! i kid you not . ridiculous . we later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola . while the footage rolls , al and annie start making out . this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much . watching the footage of the cross dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud . is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way ? the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag , certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman , while piloting a helicopter , no less . al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene . i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly . speaking of drag , another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his two wives . a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting . the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex . in fact , orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film , even when he's with annie belle . this is another minor complaint about laure there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era . it just needed more skin to punch it up . except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments , laure is actually very watchable . i love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere , not the crude stuff we see today . p . s . make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt , which stars annie al but also another famous screen couple , laura gemser and gabriele tinti . the music in that movie is also great .",1,0
"this is another case of hollywood arrogance presuming to eclipse french style . the original , mon pere ce heros , was one of the most charming films of 1991 so naturally the accountants in hollywood thought they could hire depardieu and phone the rest in . they did , however , take the precaution of hiring francis veber to write an english version albeit one utilising virtually every word of the original . depardieu brings his gallic charm and katherine heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off . the thing is that when the french make a sort of lolita lite they get away with it because the 'dirty french postcard' thinking works in their favour ; here the hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have depardieu totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover , prevailed upon to play and song 'something french' , launch into a spirited version of thank heaven for little girls . see the original .",1,0
"as a long time fan of peter o'donnell's greatest creation , i watched this film on dvd with no great hopes of enjoyment ; indeed i expected to be reaching in disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes . but instead i thoroughly enjoyed this production , and i especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the modesty blaise back story . they managed to avoid the trap of making a bad film version of the books we are all so familiar with , choosing instead to concentrate on a period in modesty's life only alluded to in the novels . as for the production values and i am no student of cinematography ! yes , the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows . but does it spoil the viewer's enjoyment ? in this case i think not . instead we are introduced to one of the world's greatest literary heroines and given a taste of her capabilities . in regard to the casting because we in unfamiliar territory the only people who really matter are modesty and perhaps professor lob . for me they were totally credible . alexandra staden , described by some as wooden , and too thin to be an action heroine , brought to the screen modesty's poise and coolness ; her technique when martial arts were needed but most importantly personified the integrity which is at the core of the modesty blaise canon . ok , so we all know this film was produced to stake miramax's claim to the modesty blaise character , it was made quickly and cheaply , but . i for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers as long as they keep to the core values and characterisations of the original stories !",1,0

"it's a soap opera drawing upon an applied ethics idea . a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie . i didn't get any emotion from it , the ideas are not at all new , the tension lacks , it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way . i mean you have this middle aged , paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than don juan . he doesn't seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years , he has no issues with god and one would probably expect that too , the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves i can't get out of my mind bergman's cries and whispers , similar to this one in many respects , which simply bursts with emotions , and not all of them humane etc . this movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but don't expect to be blown away . the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer . amenabar doesn't rub your face in it and he doesn't take sides , he doesn't want to make us fanatics for a particular idea . still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded .",1,0

"i haven't read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on , but who knows , maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health . it isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health , but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie . you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i've read on one hand , but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire , i get the feeling that she writes really good novels . the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history . still , stuart townsend's voice over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt's vampire narrative ever did , and you can tell that queen of the damned's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline . while interview decided to go with lace and elegance , queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously . one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places . the costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack . however , i'll give credit where credit is due . the soundtrack is excellent . korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead . the film opens with a very cool goth rock zoom splice montage , but after the first ten minutes or so , the directing degenerates quickly . it's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice . what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects . unfortunately , queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress . where are the yellow contacts ? where's the pale blue make up ? scene after scene , i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem's lot and fright night when low budget was done right . there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage . props to aaliyah , and may her soul forever rest in peace . she might have become a renowned actress , had her life not been taken from us so prematurely , for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing . did i mention that the soundtrack was good ? let's see , what else can i say ? it wasn't too long . the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it . there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot . but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second rate vampire movies out there . the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything . jy jimboduck dot com",1,0

this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan which was aired at least 15 years ago . the series was known as gubbarre meaning balloons . each episode was a new short story . the story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and convincing abhay doel does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a normal and third class guys as he calls himself in the movie . in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the abhays role but shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off . i would suggest watching the series if it is available . it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction . the acting of the tv actors was much better than these stars . the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour or 45 minutes story to 2 hours . so it has to get draggy . even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up . this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original tv serial . the script and the ending of the serial was much better spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him . he is aware and tell her that he doesn't want to be repayed and never helped with that intention . the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film . the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement . the deliver just wasn't right . but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy . no credit should be given to the director scriptwriter . the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of premchand munshi . i am not sure if this is premchand munshi's story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi's and other great hindi writers stories .,1,0
"i really liked batman dead end , i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film . this trailer didn't quite give me the same impression . the story line , or potential story line , was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show . first , michael o'hearn is not that good a superman . i actually thought he , in his brief appearance , made a decent clark kent . sorry , i just don't think of superman as being that buff . the suit kent wore masked his size . batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman . supes is toned no doubt but not bulk . anyway , i didn't care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy . now this may not be just o'hearn's fault , collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction . second , the special effects for flying were cheezy . superman flies through the sky . if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground , with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him . i don't think there were any full body shots of superman flying . evidently the harness and rigging supporting o'hearn must have been located on his lower torso . all in all it was a good trailer . i'd probably pay to see a film , if ever made , and would be sure to catch it on television . the story line , an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries , superman jealous of lois's attraction to wayne , lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman superman is a good one . i'm sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company , even o'hearn could deliver a decent film . certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately .",1,0

"coming from the same director who'd done candyman and immortal beloved , i'm not surprised it's a good film . ironically , papierhaus is a movie i'd never heard of until now , yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades . not talking about iranian or swedish cinema here . the acting is not brilliant , but merely solid unlike what some people here claim they must have dreamt this wondrous acting , much like anna . the story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly . these unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose , leaving it up to the individual's interpretation , and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this . pepperhaus is a somewhat unusual mix of kids' film and horror , with effective use of sounds and music . i like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie clich ultra shy but secretly brilliant social outcast girl , but a regular , normal kid ; very refreshing . i am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit like childhoods into their books and onto the screens , as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly , lonely childhood , as if that's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential . the scene with anna and the boy snogging for quite a stretch was a bit much evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement considering that she was supposed to be only 11 , but predictably it turned out that burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed . i have no idea why they didn't upgrade the character's age or get a younger actress . it was quite obvious that burke isn't that young . why directors always cast kids older than what they play , hence dilute the realism , i'll never know .",1,0

"well , i have to say , this movie was probably the funniest movie i have seen all year . and i don't exactly mean that in a good way . this is probably the most pathetic movie i have seen in a while , and yet that's what makes it so hilarious . you can tell these people are really trying to act , unfortunately for them they aren't doing such a good job , making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny . aaron carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life , and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic . this movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying . this movie is so bad , it's actually good . i would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh .",1,0
"kurosawa , fresh into color , losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on tokyo's slums . kurosawa stretches for a style that was , in my opinion , his antithesis that is to say , i feel as if kurosawa wanted to make an ozu picture . poorly paced , poorly conceived , this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work . while ikiru , while being mundane and depressing , was still interesting and well paced , and while stray dog depicted the slums and social poverty of japan without being too heavy handed or boring , do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content , with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier kurosawa pictures . be warned , this is not a movie that kurosawa should be judged by .",1,0
"after tracking it down for half a year , i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing . not disappointing because i'm one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro . but i couldn't believe goro was forced to make a movie as such . in his respectable self now , i'm sure he cringes that he made this movie . nevertheless , they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed , ill at ease and half depressed most of the time . man , i still can't believe he made this movie . i had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie . hahahaha . but i'm glad to have watched it . thank goodness he has grown up .",1,0
"wow , this was another good spin off of the original american pie , not as good as band camp , but definitely a lot better the naked mile . dwight and erik stifler lead the comedy in this one , but i actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile . the script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed more smoothly , however most of the comedy came from sex , but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway right ? the midget rock also had a really good cameo , considering the intense effort given by him in the naked mile , his scene with stifler was awesome and had me laughing my ass off when i saw it . the movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile , if you liked any previous american pie films , you should like beta house , unless you view all of the american pie spin offs a waste of money .",1,0
"seriously , i don t really get why people here are bashing it . i mean , the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd . the good news is , the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness . especially in the second half of the film , when the little killer snowballs attack , i laughed my ass off . for example , the put one of the little creeps into a blender a la gremlins 1 and mix it . after that , it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice that was fun ! . bottom line incredible movie , rent it .",1,0
"ok , i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i don't know why . i haven't seen it since , but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film again i don't know why . but the fact that i remember it speaks volumes . comedy is hard much harder than any drama . doing it right makes it seem easy , but doing it wrong . is there anything worse than a bad comedy ? steve martin , pay attention , you are falling in this category again for some reason . elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly . done at a quick pace , with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn't the philedelphia story , it entertains from start to finish . brain donors is another that fits right in this category sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes . one point of contention the ending . it seems the writers director had no idea how to finish a comedy . the ending tries to be a love story , somewhat undermining the quirky fast paced dialogue up to that point . then there is the tassle scene . whereas this has to be seen male opinion , it is so over the top and out of place it's like a shock . one more rewrite for the ending was needed . this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail . but if you don't try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you , you'll laugh , i guarantee it .",1,0
"style over substance . but what a style it is . the cell is the internal version of most serial killer movies . unfortunately , the story hardly supports the visuals . psychotherapist catherine deane j lo goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions . a new patient whose fallen into a coma , is brought to her attention by the fbi . he's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins . deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim . director tarsem singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production . each dream sequence is like a nightmare ish painting in motion , from the landscapes to the costumes . but the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters . stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about . without him , you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only , which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary . lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway , though she's as gorgeous as ever . and vince vaughn ? i don't even know why he was chosen . this is not his forte and he overacts to boot . he tried too hard to become his character and it showed . stick to comedy , vince ! even so , this movie is so visually frightening , i still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward .",1,0
"this is best showing of what i think jesus really was like . most movies show jesus as being effeminate , lobotomized , or tortured . this jesus laughed , played , and was serious when it was necessary . this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to , not the usually hollywood version . the movie took some liberties , attempting to fill in the blanks . but the fillers didn't seem impossible , or even improbable . one thing i might argue , was that it never really explained what the romans had against jesus movie portrayed that the romans were the main driver of jesus' death , not that the jewish authorities were against the idea . it seemed that the movie was researched well . one example was the offhand comment to a teenage boy who was called mark . it is believed that mark or john mark was the boy referred to at the garden of gethsemane whose cloak was pulled off and ran away naked mark 14 51 . i get the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate even in spirit was much as possible .",1,0
"i thought how the grinch stole christmas was a pretty good movie . it wasn't horrible , nor was it great , but it was enjoyable to watch . i felt as if jim carrey got a little annoying at times . they made the grinch seem like a special education person , when all he needed to be was evil and devious , but yet he turned out kind of retarded . i did think the scenery , when not inside the grinch's cave , was beautiful , and there was a few parts where i laughed , but most of the time i thought it was just annoying . this movie could've been so much better if they had changed the grinch's personality , and they had included some more laugh scenes , because most of the humor wasn't funny . i liked how the grinch stole christmas anyway , but it's not anything to get excited about seeing .",1,0
"i can't say how closely the film follows the novel , never having read the book , but since this clocks in at some six and a half hours it's a good bet that most of the base are covered or , at least , we can say with some certainty that this isn't a reader's digest condensed version . the production values are high , well up to the standards of other bbc classic series like inspector morse and sherlock holmes . we can believe dickens' london looked , sounded , and thought a lot like this . there are some occasional minor lapses some sportsman firing a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever this took place . the acting too is to be applauded . suzanne burden is the polite and honest heroine who quietly goes about doing good . she's cute too , in a mature way , her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any flirtatiousness . denholm elliott is her guardian and more than that , as it turns out . burden and elliott are two of the very few characters who are good in an unalloyed way . another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people . another is a poor and helpless young boy . i don't think anyone else could have written this . it's got all the earmarks of dickens poverty , tragic deaths , capitalism in the raw , the generous rich guy in his gated home , hidden parentage , shadowy motives , and the impotence or outright maliciousness of the justice system . well , not the justice system as a whole but the chancery , which was evidently a court that decided matters having to do with the distribution of property . so i gather from wikipedia . it became so notoriously rigid and dilatory that it was thoroughly revamped in england in 1973 . twice , elliott's character describes it as a curse . the most impressive scene involves a money scrounging creditor hounding a retired soldier in the latter's gymnasium during a fencing lesson . the sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character i remember from dickens . the apoplectic money lender and renter is screaming threats from his seat and the sergeant turns towards him and does one delicate exercise with the saber after another , each advancement bringing him closer to his tormentor , while the scarlet faced old creditor shrinks back into his seat . a couple of things are missing . often dickens will stick in at least one or two amusing lines of dialog . humbug ! or the law is a ass . not here . bleak house is the right title . second , there are practically no weberian ideal types no mr . micawbers or artful dodgers or scrooges . third , the atmosphere , the whole ethos , is relentlessly dismal . one tribulation follows another , usually having to do with money or some shameful peccadillo out of the past . my god , it's depressing . it's as if the author were venting his spleen on everything he hated in the world he knew . poverty , okay . he knew poverty . but one wonders what the chancery did to dickens to deserve this kind of treatment . maybe i should add that i've just watched the first episode of the 2005 series and it's better in two ways . there is more zip in the direction , so the pace is a little faster . and the business of jarndyce vs . jarndyce is explained satisfactorily right up front , instead of lurking about in the shadows as that mysterious curse , so the plot is easier to follow .",1,0
"the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is beauty . beauty is all around , in actors' play andie is superb as always , in well designed shots , and in authors' red line idea the love . i think the kenny's character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life . his interaction makes andie's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be . when he's gone , it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires . the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad , instead it shows that life prevails in any forms , even in this small british village , which is shown perfectly . another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways all that houses and fags and accents . and andie again is doing superb job ! it is a shame that this movie got such low marks . 10 out of ten !",1,0
"after attack of the fifty foot woman with alison hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men , there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than dorothy provine from it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world to play the role . the downsize is that cute and blonde provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into allison hayes' size 50 shoes . this role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal ; provine is more the girl next door type . she may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy , but the material lets her down . lou costello , however , proves he can do a movie without bud abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to gale gordon as his front man for gags . gordon , however , establishes that all he can be is blustery , perturbed and pushy , much the same character he creates later on the lucy show . charles lane also plays the same role in everything he does a straight man , and his screen time is limited . the special effects are convincing for the time , but i would have liked dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous . as the movie's lead character , she takes second billing to costello who is in all of the movie with dorothy several times vanishing like a sub plot . the whole movie put together just can't decide if it's supposed to be science fiction , a comedy or just a parody of the allison hayes classic . there's a lot of good scenes , some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film . still , i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women ; there's not enough movies out there like this one . if this movie had a chance to be remade today , i'd highly recommend courtney cox and jason alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely re write the original script . courtney tops my lists of actresses who i believe could and should adequately play gorgeous giantesses ; although , i have to admit that if either of the titanic beauties allison or dorothy came after me , i'd go quietly !",1,0

"forget neo and bourne and all those half baked made up modern heroes . they only look 12 year oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes . since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones , hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick . however , their action set pieces are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question . this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years . for better rocky , rambo or worse die hard 4 where john mcclane , brace yourselves . had no beard ! i say it is high time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end . this largo winch movie is far from perfect , and perhaps too predictable at times , but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action hero . and the only one time where he was weakened is when m lanie thierry shaved his beard ! i rest my case . i didn't know it when i entered the theater room , but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade . for the first time in france since belmondo , can a movie be both well crafted and rooted in b genre without blushing over its performance . in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience . in other words it was le pacte des loups or dobermann i like dobermann , mind you . i believe largo winch has what it takes to be both popular and quality film making . i exited the theater room very pleased , and hungry for more .",1,0

"sister helen is a superb documentary about a rigid , intolerant , foul mouthed , bitter , oblate civilian nun who runs a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very rundown neighborhood in the south bronx . all but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunks addicts . robert , the only middle class representative he had a real job , house , and even a bmw regrets she died before he could tell her off . why ? robert , like six of the residents , was on parole . he complained that helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didn't cow tow to her . in an extras interview he said helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life her husband and her two boys . the husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55 . one boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15 . helen was left with one daughter , who she abandoned to run the center . the daughter was not pleased . she wanted her mom what's fascinating is how little helen changed . outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change . but after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times once with the directors narrating it became clear that helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males . helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars . but her bossiness , intolerance , and sharp tongue didn't emerge at age 56 . living with her must have been extremely difficult . even robert says he stayed clean in spite of helen . the film opens with helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter . supposedly she is showing off her street savvy . another time she publicly demeans mel , her assistant for not bathing for a year . then she waves his filthy pillowcase in the air . the film is viscous with helen threatening and demeaning people . her signature song is my way . her favorite phrase is , i'm going to be totally honest with you . often , people who use such phrases , turn out o be the opposite . the residents are really down and out . only robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom . they all desperately need a roof over their heads , and helen , since she runs the place on her own , has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases . she has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding . it is her show . helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety . she stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too . she blames substance abuse on the drug or booze , and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug . she's no therapist , just a landlady who dyes her hair , wears a habit , and wields complete power over her tenants , and stopped drinking . helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine ureen she calls it tests on requests . twice major , a very solid and respected long term older resident who she trusted failed his tests . helen was furious and evicted him . major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin . helen didn't yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made . this was especially troubling since she knew major for a long time . yet she discounted her relationship with him , assumed he was a liar , and relied completely on the results . major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate . helen never apologized publicly , but supposedly made up with major privately . helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood . she tacitly admitted to robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someone's tires . the person wronged her and certainly deserved to have his her tires slashed . she was not a nice woman . so eventually , she decided the only way to keep the travis name her last name alive since the three male travises died was to start the travis center . for some of the residents it was a great deal . they complied with helen and in exchange received a cheap , safe , sober , and structured place to live . one however , said he preferred jail . addicts and drunks don't all need to be treated like children . helen employed old school techniques which have been discredited . however , no one was forced to remain at the center and for some , it was definitely a positive experience . the travis center is not a treatment center . it is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who what to straighten out their lives . to receive the full sister helen experience , see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with sister helen and her guests .",1,0

"okay , sure , this movie is a bit on the hokey side . it's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility dolph lundgren as the punisher , anyone ? , but this tries very hard . i've never read the actual comic book , but that doesn't really matter , i suppose . i judge a film mainly on its merits , not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea . unless its a film based on a true story , that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy . so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating ? because it tries . it tries very hard . in my book , that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film . many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus . it seems everybody has their take on vampire lore , be it the cross , the silver , the garlic , the aversion to sunlight , whatever . some of those ideas are included here . the storyline is familiar . a group of vampires conspire to take over the world , with one person mainly standing in their way . blade wesley snipes lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses , who have slowly but surely moved into the world , and share it with humankind . for the most part , the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them . the vampires have even taken familiars , people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turned . now that i think of it , there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the roddy piper film , they live . a hidden enemy , hidden group of people plotting against them , the fight to save human kind . all that is present in blade as well . the acting isn't the best here . snipes is , at best , only slightly better than some of his other roles ; n'bushe wright , a relative newcomer , isn't too bad ; kris kristofferson is forgettable as blade's sidekick he's to blade what chip is to the punisher . stephen dorff does the best job of the whole cast here , as the head vampire you just love to hate . i don't know , but i just loved the special effects in this film . from the blood soaked vampire style rave , all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film , the special effects aren't half bad . there's certainly enough blood and gore to go around , but after all , this is a vampire movie , right ? the various shapes and sorts of weaponry blade uses are fairly unique , and not generally used in contemporary action films . snipes has more flair with a decked out sword than he does with , say , a machine gun . plus , there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away . unless , of course , you are indiana jones . overall , this isn't the best action film ever made , but it's not half bad , either . as a bonus , the musical score soundtrack are pretty cool , too . tell me , in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like source direct or photek ? ! my rating 8 10",1,0
"the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point . it's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time , or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace . if only it was that easy . but the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better , as the situation gets worse and worse every single day . well , if you're not part of the solution , you're part of the problem . the central theme is that revenge begets more revenge , which begets even more , in an ever expanding bloodbath . both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side , which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation . where does it end ? and apparently he missed the significance of the bubble referred to in the name , which was that people living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them , which is partly why they seemed so naive . he also seemed to think that ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem , which tells me he wasn't paying attention when ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered . i found it very brave of the director , the screenplay writer , and both star crossed lovers , to update the romeo juliet story to a modern troubled land , and to make both lovers male . let's be honest here very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female young love wins all hearts but when people's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that , incredibly , these same people would rather have them hate each other , then the conclusion is inevitable .",1,0
"okay , my title is kinda lame , and almost sells this flick short . i remember watching siskel ebert in '94 talking about this movie , and then playing a clip or two . not being a rap conscious guy although i could identify snoop dogg , vanilla ice , and mc hammer music , i wasn't much interested when they started talking about the film . but then , s e showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name using some shady logic and a bunch of made up facts , and then another scene where the band , and their rival band , both visit a school to promote getting involved and , of course , nwh comes up with some info about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee . so i filed it away that i should see this movie . a couple of years later , this thing shows up on hbo and i recorded it , only to laugh my butt off for hours . yes , it has a spinal tap kind of rhythm to it . even the documentarist takes essentially the same tone in setting up the clips , and the band follows a similar path what i now call the behind the music phenomenon smalltime band has good chemistry , gets famous , too much money too fast , squabbling , drugs , some type of death , band breaks up , then reconciles , finishing with a hope for more albums in the future , and fade to black . the one thing that is true is that in spinal tap , you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past . but tap drags at some points , and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes . oh , this is his rant about the backstage food , this is spot where he wants the amp to go to eleven , this is the spot where the guy makes the pint sized stonehenge , etc . contrasting to foabh , which seems to have more unexpected humor . you can see some of it coming , but there isn't a big setup for every joke . sometimes , the jokes just kinda flow . cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked . also , the direct references to vanilla ice , hammer , and a bunch of other caricature type rappers really worked well . this strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs , and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes . and the songs . is my peanuts better than big bottom from spinal tap ? i don't know but they're both damn funny . tone def's awful video during his awakening phase is so bizarre , yet so funny . i could go on awhile , but save your time and don't waste it on cb4 . i watched the first half hour , and got bored . you don't get bored on foabh . there are slightly less funny moments , but you can never tell when something good is about to happen . perhaps my favorite scene is when ice cold and tastey taste name ripoffs if i've ever heard any discover they've been sharing the same girl . at one point , you've got those two pointing guns at each other , and the next thing you know , the manager , the photographer , the girl , and i think even tone def are in the room pointing guns at each other , switching targets back and forth . and , of course , someone does get shot . i did find it odd that nwh's managers suffered similar fates to spinal tap's drummers although none spontaneously combusted , i don't think . there were enough similarities that i cannot ignore the likelihood that cundieff saw spinal tap prior to writing this film , although this is clearly much more the spinal tap of hip hop . while some similarities exist , the humor is different , and the movie seems more like a real documentary maybe because we don't recognize a single actor in this thing , even the guy who played lamar from revenge of the nerds . all in all , this movie has , in my opinion , street cred . kinda like nwh .",1,0

i suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay . i thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called the fear halloween night . i expected this movie to be somewhat of a halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy . but it opened with a good scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people including his mother and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit . pretty good for a sequel and i never even seen the first .,1,0
"i tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch . i was immediately sucked in by the characters . robin tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film . her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100 believable . really , this sort of thing is not easy to do . she pulls it off fantastically . we know early on this film is going to end tragically , but you cannot take your eyes off of it . the characters do stupid things , but unlike most hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it , these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters . this is just a great example of film making imho . great writing , great acting , great directing . a film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment .",1,0
"let me be the first non australian to comment on this i got the movie for hugo weaving and i watched it to the end . it's one of those drama of life films , as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive . i liked the light and the girls . the rest was without too much fault , but without too much merit either . i yearned for something like the interview , or at least some matrix villain element here and there , but nothing out of the ordinary . the story does teach one about facing one's own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you , but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close , so not much of an effort to change things is required . the smart american beauty sound alike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack , but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film . in the end , i guess it did his job of presenting a part of australian life , but to me it didn't seem specifically australian it could have been placed anywhere and it didn't seem attractive as a story . i guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie .",1,0
"soderbergh is a fabulous director , but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels . clearly , he knew this from the get go . the term star vehicle has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star . what this film does is net a whole herd of hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before . the last scene says it all all the stars sitting around with nothing happening and nothing being said . we just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where george clooney , catherine zeta jones , matt damon , brad pitt , and don cheadle are just hanging out , being themselves . so the story's not important at all at least , that's not where the films' greatest pleasures come from . if you want a clever heist movie , better stick with 11 . but if star gazing turns you on , this will make your day .",1,0
"let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice , i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie . those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears . i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors . the acting was better than average , but the plot held no surprises . they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation . now as to the historical errors , if you call them that , the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april , then capt . pike , jim kirk , etc . according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology that's the reason a prime directive was created but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series . i hope the plots will get deeper , and then special effects can take a backseat .",1,0
"this film is available from david shepard and kino on the before hollywood there was fort lee , nj , although that is a shortened version with just the behind the scenes movie sections . i'm not sure if blackhawk films only had a film print of these parts , or they edited out the other scenes . the original blackhawk version was retitled a movie romance . the complete feature does survive , but the preprint for this version had some nitrate decomposition , and a couple of sections looked bad , so that may be why blackhawk's version was edited . directed by maurice tourneur , the film has tourneur playing himself , or more likely a caricature of himself . supposedly , director emile chautard and future director joseph von sternberg also can be spotted . country lass mary doris kenyon longs for a romantic man to sweep her off her feet . she dreams of a troubadour that will woo her , but is constantly interrupted by the only available local boy , johnny applebloom . meanwhile , a film company from new york actually new jersey is filming a western in the countryside . mary sees an indian in full headdress and raises an alarm spoiling a scene that the movie company is filming . she is immediately attracted to the dashing film star kenneth driscoll robert warwick . he encourages her to leave her home and try to become an actress in the big city . when she arrives at the studio , she discovers that everything about the movies is fake . the doors and walls are just flats that are hastily assembled for the set . that lanky walk of the western hero or the happy skip of the heroine are just acting too . the sets are on a big revolving stage , so the angle of the sun can even be manipulated . the black attendant at the studio signs all the movie stars' autographed photos . the signs on the wall say positively no smoking , but everybody smokes anyway . even the titles of the film which are illustrated nicely emphasize everything fake about the movie making life . movie star driscoll is just as disenchanted with the ho hum of everyday film making . he makes a temporary split from girlfriend vivian june elvidge to pursue this exciting country girl . his plans are dashed when mary's screen test is a stinker . we don't get to see the actual film , but only the audience's pained reactions to it . mary is devastated , but she doesn't want to admit to everyone back home that she was a failure , so she continues to see driscoll and we she has lunch with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras dressed as policemen , soldiers , cowboys , etc . mary decides to stay with driscoll . at a party with their movie friends , she agrees to marry him although there is not much love between them . surprisingly , her mother appears , with a cake especially for mary's birthday . this causes mary to re evaluate her future . this film has all kinds of fascinating scenes of studios , movie sets , dressing rooms , editing rooms , etc . if you've always wondered what went on behind the scenes when a silent film was being made , this movie peeks behind the curtain .",1,0
"legend of dragoon is one of those little known games that people either love or hate . some people claim it's far too similar to other games , namely the final fantasy series which is understandable , since it was originally intended to be sony's equivalent of final fantasy . honestly i can't comment on the similarities beyond that , as i'm not very familiar with the ff games . i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system . not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form , but every time you attack , you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time . not only that , sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence , which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage . even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of button mashing . if you don't want to attack , you can always guard , which not only cuts any damage taken in half , but raises your hit points without the use of healing potions . the fmvs are quite well done , about the same quality as final fantasy 8's . however , the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard . they're nice , but they could have been and honestly , should have been better . the translation as well leaves something to be desired . not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions , but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldn't have been allowed to pass . another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party characters one dies , and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves . while the death of the one character is often said to have no point , it makes you realize early on that the characters , while heroes , are still just as mortal as the next person . the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats , so the transition game play wise is fairly smooth . perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love interest , shana . she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing , pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration . while you can use her in your party , she is insanely weak i don't even know what her dragoon powers are like , as i disliked her so much i never used her . the character rose , by contrast , is probably my favorite female character in any game ever . she's no wimp , and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful . meru is quite strong as well , while sometimes being an annoying talkative brat . the character designers were , as most are , inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever , and didn't give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits . seriously , no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters . but i will give them props , as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries . i can't comment much on the plot , as honestly i didn't pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next . i'm not sure if this says something about the plot itself , or my gaming style . all in all , it's a very enjoyable game . it has its flaws , but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters .",1,0
"i have watched this movie on dvd a couple of times now , the first time , i watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour . an engrossing entertaining film , thank god no kiera knightley in it , refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of queen victoria and the difficult choices she had to make . nothing bad about the movie at all , no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing . might prompt the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as conroy and lord melbourne",1,0

"soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be . i found the film to have some of the sacarstic , cynical humour like that in paul verhoven's starship troopers . the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere . one particular trivia bit stands out for me todd has the names of several space war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate . for the oblivious ones out there , tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy batty's elegiac last lines in blade runner . to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least . maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic ? i'll give this one 3 out of 5 .",1,0

"i believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of 8000 but that didn't really show . there wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting , the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of aberdeen . the actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious , deserted and uncharted planet , none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive . there weren't any great explanations of what was going on , which can be really contrived , so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination rather like the big empty which was a film i also enjoyed . i found that i quite warmed to most of the characters , there were some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments , the men were so ordinary that you felt you could empathise with them and the film's climax and ending were quite poignant . i think mr stirton and his crew should be quite proud of themselves i've seen worse films with a budget of millions .",1,0

"the problem with tv today is that people have been spoiled by lite tv viewing . this type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or easy listening jazz . the typical viewers idea of continuity is remembering who got voted off the island last week and wondering who will be the next to go . show them a program like surface , firefly , dr . who , or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and . well , they'll just flip back to survivor . 95 of the sheep watching tv don't want to rack their brains . they want excuses to not think . they want to make sure the boob tube lives up to its name . and they don't want shows that try and go any other route . because of this , surface and many other high quality shows that should have lasted far longer have gotten the axe . tv viewers don't want stories , or morals , or philosophy , or anything over a third grade vocabulary level . they want people eating earthworms , or over dramatized real life series no such thing ! you cannot observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe or hormonal shows involving groups of people having trysts and then bragging about it to their friends . today's television is nothing but a wasteland , and the few diamonds you can pick out of the dust are just tossed out because no one even knows what a diamond is anymore . surface was one of those diamonds .",1,0
"while the main story is supposed to take place in morocco , this movie was shot in foggy romania in 18 days on a very tight budget . however broken their cards may be , the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment , so that in the end i found the result both touching and graceful . nikolaj coaster waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy . the script and direction provide some gems . whether you will like the movie or not , however , will probably depend on your take on alexandra staden in the title role . other reviewers have pointed out staden's inadequacies as modesty blaise . they may have a point , but i found her interpretation delightful and very fitting . modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline , innate talent and courage . staden appears to be doing the same here .",1,0

"robert culp they call his character doctor . i think he's a vet or something and family move to an affluent , low tax , zero law enforcement suburb . lantern jawed culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and go cruising through his front yard at 60mph . he presses charges , which arouses the kids' ire , and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign . marilyn manson , er , marlyn mason rather , plays his fretful , boiled celery wife , who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses , and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services . but the system is getting culp nowhere , and he's not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music . and we all know what movie people do when the system fails . but this is based on a true story , which makes it even better . it should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient '70s funk o matic teenage theme music that warns us when they're up to no good , this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even handedly really ! . it doesn't make a big generational thing out of it . kudos for that . anyway , if you like dogs or at least believe in protecting their civil rights , like me , and you like justice , and you like fire , and you like justice for dogs by way of fire , and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are too damn soft , then this flick's ethos is up your alley . no , it's not really good , at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word . there's nothing subtle or understated or clever about it , it's just sort of a feature length psa for vigilantism . it does , however , capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other , beloved works . remember in frank miller's the dark knight returns when batman leads the mutants on horseback to reclaim gotham city ? remember that scene in a christmas story where the kid pounds the bully's face in ? remember how cool that was ? or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors ? yeah , mon . unfortunately , this was a 1973 made for tv movie that i just happened to catch at 4am on my local wb affiliate , and it's probably not destined for dvd release . but after being inspired by this film , do you think i'm gonna just sit here and take it ! ? !",1,0

"michael stearns plays mike , a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality . he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that's when he loses it . he believes that when women actually have sex that's when they lose any sense of innocence and or beauty . so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance , ultimately shooting the men dead with a high powered rifle with a scope . the seeming primary reason for this movie's existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again . the story comes off as more of an afterthought . this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we're treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation . of course , seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism . for one thing , mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger . this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack . those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another . it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain how to react . it unfolds at a very slow pace , but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist . it's a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen . 7 10",1,0
"in france , it's considered polite from french critics to genuflect to the apparently cohesive chain of films brian de palma left behind him . however , a good proportion of his films are marred by bombastic effects carrie 1976 , the fury 1978 scarface 1983 without mentioning his borrowings from hitchcock . here , in dressed to kill , it's impossible not to think of vertigo 1958 for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in psycho 1960 . about our involved film , i don't want to revive the old debate does de palma rip off hitchcock ? instead , i would tend to be generous and to classify dressed to kill in the category of de palma's winners alongside sisters 1973 and obssession 1976 . with however some reservations and they're the ones i previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between de palma's rabid fans and his detractors . if there's one sure thing in dressed to kill which can generate general agreement among film lovers , it's de palma's virtuosity in directing . he wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do . his sophisticated camera work brilliantly fuels the suspense which entails a rise of the tension and a discomforting aura . the audience is easily glued in front of the screen . this is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures . by the way , in psycho , there were also long silent , suspenseful parts . but the main drawback in de palma's 1980 vintage is that the quality of the plot can't be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic , corny ingredients pertaining to an incalculable number of murder stories . the prostitute is the sole witness of the crime . then , she's suspected by the police and has to act on her own with a little help from the victim's son from the scene in the subway onwards to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence . apart from the fact that de palma uses a type of character who for once isn't demeaned at all , it's a menu which smells the reheated . and the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one . yes , it's superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function , one figures it's almost gratuitous filler . perhaps de palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows and even before who the killer is . the two central mainsprings in de palma's set of themes articulate hinges on manipulation and voyeurism . the latter theme is well present in dressed to kill from the first scene onwards which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie . and the filmmaker isn't afraid to film his main actress and wife nancy allen in her underwear . i find his approach about this theme rather doubtful . but maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and de palma wanted to stir his peeping tom side . i don't want to demean at all de palma's work . his prestigious work in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspects . twenty six years after , the controversy he aroused amid movie goers isn't ready to subside .",1,0
"you can debate prince's acting talent , or even his choice to parody his own life in this film . there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now . he seems like a shadowy has been twenty years later , but the music remains relevant and fantastic . having lived through the hype of this movie graduated high school in'85 i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time . from tipper gore al's wife trying to censor little nikki and every thing else under the sun via the pmrc parents music resource center to every air band at the time impersonating prince , it was the absolute hottest thing out . for a few weeks at least , prince was bigger than madonna and michael jackson . we all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered . it didn't disappoint . everyone was caught up . i was an mtv junkie at the time they actually played music then . all the time prince played at least once or twice an hour . i must qualify this commentary by saying that , at that time , my favorites were billy idol , oingo boingo , the fixx , flock of seagulls and others in the punk new wave genre' the music of prince at the time transcended all types and styles . one of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was soooooooo big then . all the things that remind you of the 80's were iconic then . it was mainstream and it seems like a clich ' now . it got so popular that it became ridiculous . it's like the rappin' granny commercial for wendy's hamburgers . it looks stupid now because everyone was caught up in it sadly , kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something . anyway , i hope this gave you all a little insight .",1,0
"ok , i got the dvd set last week and i am finally getting around to posting my reviews , but i sure liked this sequel in many ways . zombie bloodbath 2 rage of the undead . ok . this one movies at a fast clip , has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style . i would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish dv shot flicks that i have bought . most of the time , i get rather angry at dv movies for being boring and looking like soap operas . even a movie like bone sickness that i like , has incredible stretches of dull . not this movie . it never stops long enough to let you catch your breath . although i wouldn't say i liked it better than the first film , i will say that sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films . this one has better gore , the inevitable zombie feeding scenes , scumbag characters , and a few returning actors although their roles are different mainly jerry angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell . the shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film . some of it works and some of it doesn't , but i have to say that at least he wasn't just trying to do a larger version of the first film . there was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage , just satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life . so i say kudos to mr . sheets for trying to do something different with this one . i give this film two bloody thumbs up !",1,0
"this is not a serious film , and does not pretend to be , but it is not as bad as some of its reviews , it's title , and the first ten minutes lead you to expect . the plot is very silly , but this adds to the light hearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film . the characters are played sympathetically , and while they do engage in typical teenage angst , they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre . unusually set in london , sympathetic to geeks , this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on ; if you want some tongue in cheek silliness , and don't mind suspending your disbelief .",1,0

"when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long , i thought we were in trouble . condensing the gigantic w . somerset maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen . but you know , the movie's not half bad , and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers . i've heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet noodle of an actor , and he was , but i can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet noodle , for that's certainly what carey is . howard plays him well , which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly , then finally take him out and buy him a spine . ah , and then there's bette , as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him . i didn't know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book , and the movie stays true to that detail . but as played by davis , she does become the most fascinating character in the story , and if she's nasty and unlikable , she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time . davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting , much as brando's would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out stella ! in that little known tennesee williams play , and it's not hard to see why . davis is intense to the point of scary . she makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience , and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous . her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an std is shocking . of course , it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect ; if it had been made a year later , you can bet things would have been a bit different . yes , much of the novel , and many of its most interesting parts , are left on the cutting room floor , and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else . i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of maugham's novel , but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now , so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did . grade b",1,0

"i'm not sure where to start with this . in short , it was a disappointing movie . having taught the novella , i was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie . the movie has a couple of interesting lines mainly between alfred and aschenbach but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella . for one , i was expecting an older aschenbach and a younger tadzio . in the book , tadzio is fourteen , but he is described as pure , ideal , innocent , whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease . he is an accomplice to aschenbach , he always looks back at him , almost provokingly . in the book , it is aschenbach who steals glances at the boy . as for aschenbach , i imagined something closer to the professor turned clown in the blue angel based on a story by thomas mann's brother heinrich than this forty year old with hardly any gray hair . in all fairness , i do think that dirk bogarde did a good job , but either someone else should have done that , or he should have made to look older at the beginning . i know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story , but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the apollonian and dyonisian inspirations and focuses instead on aschenbach's obsession of tadzio and does not justify it . i liked the fact that mahler's music was used , because ultimately he did inspire mann to write his story . i'm not sure turning aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move . or the creation of alfred who i don't remember in the book . and one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips . i was wondering if it was dubbed because i expected it to be in italian . but then i remembered that each italian movie i have watched has this problem . it just bothers me because these directors fellini is the other person i'm thinking of are supposed to epitomize perfection in italian cinema , and here are their characters laughing without sound , then you hear a noise that doesn't correspond to their faces i'm thinking of the scenes when aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing . this scene could should have been the strongest , but it was annoying instead .",1,0

"it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about . the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate . the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this a plot to kill the president of the united states . michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed . kiefer sutherland co stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine . one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president , it also concerns a mole traitor in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction .",1,0

christian viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema's sexiest and most notorious stars . jenna jameson , chasey lain , ginger lynn allen and taylor hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since scream reinvigorated the genre . samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in october 2002 thus keeping in check with the halloween based synopsis . unfortunately , the shoot was plagued by numerous problems , which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves . last i heard it had been signed by film 2000 here in the uk and was penned for a late october release direct to dvd . unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with dtv slashers . not content with polluting our shelves with camp blood and its follow up , they were also responsible for unleashing granny , bleed and the rancid paranoid . could samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon ? five canadian american students and their teacher head to southern ireland as part of their history course . upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of scotland and murdered locals for food . the cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake , but it's rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of ireland to find refuge . after the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre fodder does in these flicks , the mandatory goody two shoes and definite heroine candidate begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night . could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the forest ? well what do you think ? it looks as if samhain's production was jinxed right from the start . almost immediately wallmart refused to develop jenna jameson's nude make up shots , and chasey lain began acting characteristically like a drugged out primadonna . finally to add insult to injury , the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re editing and removing all the gore . reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an r rating . veil of course disagreed , seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display . eventually after months of arguments , the director parted company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults . despite countless disruptions , veil's slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium . the copy i was sent was the pre release screener , which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack . but still it boasted a few credible jump scares , some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that i've seen for some time . one guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine , jenna jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and chasey lain ends up 'spilling her guts' after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend richard grieco . even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome , samhain never feels mean spirited , which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clich s . in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall , because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes craven's scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them . certainly the inclusion of the mouth watering jenna jameson was a great move by the producers . her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top as expected and so does chasey lain and taylor hayes . but samhain is no soft porn movie , and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce . it's worth noting that the aforementioned xxx stars almost out perform the supposed 'actors' of the feature , which isn't much of a complement . ginger lynn was at least notable if you ignore the shameful 'oirish accent , and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan chou . taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics , which could have been caused by the numerous problems on set . veil's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much needed injections of suspense . exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds . it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of samhain . rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending , and i'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution . if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched , then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years . this one is certainly worth checking out",1,0
"i find it hard to believe this could happen at all . we do not know if justin and richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past . the movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble . so the first crime they commit is murder ? just to play and jostle with the cops ? how do they pick up any girl and just say you are it ? also richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle . hmmm . this whole concept is really hard to believe . that said let's move on . i found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then . as for cassie who was a victim of carl hudson has a horrible time trying to survive . the memory of having been stabbed 17 times by carl leaves her in an emotional mess . sandra does a superb acting job . she sure made me believe she was one angry cop . as for solving the crime , i thought it was great . this movie kept me planted in my chair . loved the acting of all but sam . he had no get up and go . the one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should i say the rape scene .",1,0
"as a big dostoyevsky fan , i had always been disappointed with hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the russian romantic aesthetic case in point , yul brynner as dmitri karamazov . i had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions , but then i saw yul as major surov and changed my mind . when given an intelligent script to work with , he suddenly came alive and was as noble , sexy , and conflicted as you could ever want a neurotic russian officer to be ! so he was a better dmitri as major surov than he was as dmitri . but that's because writer tabori actually gave yul , as the conflicted russian officer , the kind of conflicted russian officer lines that are worthy of real literature , and that have real meaning and pathos in them . for example , a propos of folk music , he says musingly , you hear a man crying in the dark . and if you listen carefully enough , you know what he cries for . you look surprised , lady ashmore . despite what you may have heard , tractors and marxism aren't the only things the russian cares for . there is always time for music . brilliant !",1,0
"probably the best horror movie in 5 years . there's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared when all they make you do is walk out of the theater and movies that just shouldn't have been made . but this one is worth it . the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because paris hilton is in it but her death scene makes up for it , believe me . . so here they are . the spoilers of all the death scenes in the movie . 1 . my favorite death scene ever paris hilton's ! after finding her boyfriend blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck , paige starts to run . well , speed walk is more respectable . she finds this like garage with all these cars in it . then one of the killers cuts her ankle from below this whole time shes holding a huge metal spike so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car . the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead . i've never been so excited or laughed so hard in my life . 2 . paige's boyfriend blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him while hes on the ground and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat . then he dies . 3 . elisha cuthbert carly one of the hottest chicks ever doesn't die phew but she does get her lips super glued together , punched in the face , and gets part of her index finger chopped off yeah , i felt like heaving 4 . carly's twin brother nick also survives , but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg . 5 . nicks best friend dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs , and then is decapitated . his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink . then he gets covered in wax . 6 . wade carly's boyfriend gets his achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors , and then is attacked by the same scissors . he doesn't die , but hes covered in wax , and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed , revealing his nasty bloody flesh . yummy . . so there it is . definitely worth your money .",1,0
"the deer hunter's success with critics and publics alike led united artists to give cimino carte blanche on heaven's gate , an epic western about the 1892 johnson county wars the elliptical story , about the persecution of lowly european born farmers by wyoming's cattle barons , was a muddled mixture of class conflict , sumptuous pageant and underwritten , stereotypical characters however , cimino's fetish for authenticity and his sweeping sense of scale ensured that the film running at nearly four hours was rarely tedious its undeserved status as a cause c l bre , with critics divided as to whether it was a masterpiece or a fiasco , derived from its inflated budget blamed for the studio's financial problems , cimino became a scapegoat for hollywood's general decline , and the film , edited into an incomprehensible short version after its initial release , was a commercial disaster",1,0
"when i first saw the premiere episode of farscape , i had no idea what to expect . i was immensely impressed and satisfied with premiere . subsequent re watches , however , have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially . premiere is not a great farscape episode , but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters . the episode begins with john crichton ben browder , an astronaut and scientist , preparing to launch into space in the farscape module , a small space ship perfected by crichton and his friend dk . crichton has a revealing conversation with his father , jack crichton , and then begins his test flight in space . of course , everything goes wrong and crichton is shot through a wormhole and winds up in a distant part of the galaxy . after exiting the wormhole , crichton's module is pulled on board a living space ship . from here , the characters and story line for the farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner . the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode . of course , there is crichton , played well by ben browder . he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with . he's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything . in premiere , crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeepers . he knows nothing at all about either side , but in helping aeryn a captured peacekeeper pilot it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers . he probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for crais , a peacekeeper captain , declaring crichton to be the murderer of his brother . this puts crichton in an interesting situation he's stuck with bizarre , violent escaped prisoners in a far off galaxy about which he knows nothing at all . crichton's total lack of knowledge of the farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during farscape's first season . the supporting cast is just as compelling . there's zhaan , a blue delvian and former prisoner . she's peaceful and reasonable , as opposed to fellow prisoner ka d'argo , a powerful and hard headed warrior . virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup , allowing her character of zhaan to appear cool and convincing . d'argo's mega makeup , in contrast , is below par . he looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose , and there is something peculiar about his eyes . they look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup . farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in season 1 , but the overall costume would , for me at least , remain as a problem until season 2 . the puppet digital characters of rygel and pilot are , to put it simply , excellent . rygel is a tiny hynerian dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft . in premiere he is given some good dialogue but not much else . pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship , moya , and moya's passengers . even in the first episode , pilot gives off the appearance of being a real , living alien ; he never once in the show seems to be a giant , expensive machine . the peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well . the peacekeepers are made up of a race called sebaceans , who look just like humans . the chief antagonist is introduced in premiere as captian crais , who believes that crichton killed his brother . in reality , crais's brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with crichton's ship . aeryn sun , a pilot who crichton helps escape , tries to explain that the death was an accident , but crais just claims that she is irreversiby contaminated and refused to change his mind . crais obsession for revenge , warranted or not it should be clear to crais that crichton isn't responsible , is mysterious in premiere , but would be explained later in the season . aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character . by being forced to leave the peacekeepers , she changes her whole way of life , and is in that regard in a similar though less severe situation as crichton . the actual episode , as mentioned earlier , feels somewhat rushed and clunky . so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything . also , d'argo for now looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing . still , premiere is solid entertainment . the special effects such as in the starburst sequences are impressive . most of the costumes and the sets on board moya are original . despite its flaws , premiere is a must see for farscape fans . 3 4",1,0
"an old saying goes if you think you have problems , visit a hospital . that has been updated in recent years to if you think you have problems , watch a tv talk show . especially jerry springer's ! this movie is one of those that is so bad , it's good ! that's why i gave it a seven it's all right , but not great . it's a great way to waste 95 minutes , just as the daily talk show is advertised as an hour of your life you'll never get back ! all the familiar themes are here . unfaithful husbands boyfriends , the wildest audience on television , women flashing jerry , etc . the shocker was watching molly hagan , who normally plays sweet characters seinfeld and herman's head playing a trailer trash mom and jaime pressly my name is earl as her equally trashy daughter , performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact . the men including the staff producer were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got . i don't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show . here in phoenix , it's shown back to back for two hours every morning and , after that , everything else seems to pale . again , i give this movie a seven . it's good but not great . jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses .",1,0

"when you read about this film you wanna cringe . i have seen it countless times and yet i cringe myself ! so what is the attraction here ? i think that for me , it's the offbeatness of the romance . i find it super refreshing to have an oddball coupling between this nyc jimmy breslin like columnist and a down on her luck health wise ballerina . you feel embarrassed for paul sorvino at his unsubtle approach to wooing this woman . like the guy in the bar who can't take a hint . he's a bit overweight at least as a would be suitor for a ballerina . hope that doesn't sound unkind and possibly a tad too old for her . nice change of pace from greek god wooing super model . the bill conti score has stuck in my head all these years later , which is a pretty good sign . however some of the acting is just dreadful . a subplot involving a young puerto rican boy befriended by sorvino's character is just hilariously bad . but the opening scene where ditchburn is warming up to carole king draws you right into this story . good luck finding it . you'd think that lifetime would be re airing this or even we , but i haven't seen it on in quite a few years .",1,0
"what the heck do people expect in horror films these days anyway . does is have to be something grisly like 'saw' or it's just crap . ? now , i don't claim to be an all knowing expert , but i'm about 47 , i've seen and own literally thousands of films and i honestly think this director really gave this film a good , sincere effort . believe me , i was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started , assuming it was gonna be awful and i was pleasantly surprised . it's no mamet script , that's for sure ; but come on ! with all the horrible garbage out there , especially in horror , i thought this one was way closer to the top of the pile than most . the director used a lot of neat , clever camera angles ; the soundtrack was excellent and moody , perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film . the editing and timing were very good . and it didn't resort to the tired , worn clich of excessive 'slasher' violence ; for example minor spoiler during an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous but tasty . , uh , i mean tasteful nude shower scene i fully expect her to get sliced and diced ; but , amazingly we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that's it end minor spoiler also , the tension was built very well , leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what . spoiler especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and pinnochio alone in the office ; we see the doll actually talking to her , but in the video recording we do not . also , the mom sees pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty ; so , are both the mom and daughter mentally ill . ? also there is the original 'killer' and what the mom had surmised about a possible evil influence . but even with all that , we are still not quite sure who was doing the killing end spoiler so , all in all , i believe that it was a good , strong , sincere effort to create some good ol' early full moon type style and with a lot of restraint on the violence . and with no typical sleaze thrown in for no reason just the lovely , innocent , beautiful shower scene , which i will remember to the end of my days . compared to the absolute mindless drivel out there , a definite , strong 8 10 !",1,0

"as shallow as it may sound , i actually delayed my viewing of the barbarians several times just because the vhs cover as well as the picture image displayed here on the website looks so incredibly gay ! by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isn't so much gay . just trashy , cheesy , campy and enormously fun ! it's almost unbelievable that ruggero deodato , director of cannibal holocaust of all people , was the man responsible for this comical cash in on the contemporary popular sword sandal fantasy flicks , particularly schwarzenegger's conan movies . the film opens with a terrific 'once upon a time' type of off screen narrator , introducing us to the ragneks . their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers . in other words , the ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks ! their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy kadar kidnaps the ragneks' beautiful queen canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby . meanwhile , and as some sort of amusing waste of time , the two orphan twin brothers gore and kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and they're unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death . instead of that , however , they escape and develop a plan to free their queen . actually , the plot isn't half as bad as i initially feared , but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers' on screen chemistry , the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy monsters , like a dragon with adorably cute eyes , some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp . the soundtrack and make up effects are great and our almighty director deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace . the barbarian brother's acting capacities are much better than i anticipated , apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds . the supportive cast is splendid as well . eva la rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl cara , virginia bryant is indeed bewitching like richard lynch states on several occasions and the lovely sheeba alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut shaped hair style i kid you not ! . last but not least , the barbarians stars everybody's favorite eyes in the hills creep michael berryman as the appropriately named dirtmaster . i know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the village people , but the barbarians really is a must see italian exploitation highlight .",1,0

"in my line of work , i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film . when i can , i take a look at these low budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs . once in a while , though , there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire , as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible . the short film b r o k e n , directed by alex ferrari , is a genuine surprise and worth a second look . clocking in at a scant 20 minutes , b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story . the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening . a young woman samantha jane polay awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home . when she awakes , she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book . these nasty guys and girls are larger than life . they are all guns and knives . there is no way out . the kicker here is that , despite being a low budget film it doesn't play like one . from the very beginning , the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot , edited , and produced by professionals . it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers . the film is sharp and cool , it looks good and it feels like something big . the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films . polay and paul gordon who plays the head killer , duncan were well chosen . as two of the few speaking roles in the film , it is up to them to carry the film . no special effects , no matter how good , would have saved this film from bad acting . thankfully , polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho . some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent , but it hardly shows . the downside to b r o k e n is that it's only 20 minutes long . the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle . watching it , i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany , but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be . the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop , but it comes off as unsatisfying . i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film . my rating 8 out of 10 .",1,0

"so here's a bit of background on how i came to see this movie . as you probably know , this is the original french film , that was then remade quelle surprise by hollywood as wicker park . well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released , simply because , a i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park , and living in chicago , i didn't see why they called it that it was filmed in fricking canada for a start ! b i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes , done purely because hollywood thinks we're too bone idle to read a few subtitles i am dreading the remake of infernal affairs by the way and c i can't stand josh hartnett , 'nuff said there . however , i came across wp on tv the other day , probably about half an hour in , and i have to say initially , it made no sense at all , until about half an hour from the end , when it started coming together . by the end , i was really surprised to find myself really into it , and then the ending just seemed so good a perfect combination of story , passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices i've ever seen heard ? . since then i've heard a lot about the l'appartement vs . wicker park argument and looking at wp , i still say it has bugger all to do with chicago , but there seemed something about it that i liked , so when it was on again , i watched it again unfortunately , still missing the first chunk i've still yet to see it ! , and i still thought it was pretty good . heck , even josh hartnett seemed good ! but i was curious about l'appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about . so i waited and waited to catch l'appartement somewhere somehow . netflix let me down , so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland . and i've just watched it . it's really kind of weird , but a good weird . a classic french film . great acting , romane bohringer is an absolute gem sorry , but she acts monica bellucci off the screen in every scene . vincent cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works . and i've seen jean philippe ecoffey in a lot of movies and i just love him the scene where alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his puppy's been run over was excruciating ! but , i can honestly say , having seen wp and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy as about 75 of the rest of the movie had been maybe in a different order , but come on , the scene with the coffee in the glasses ? word for word ! , you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of l'appartement ! i can literally say i was blown away hmm , a bit like poor old lucien was through the cafe window really ! so , be prepared , if you've seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did , do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie , because you'll either be disappointed , or exhilarated at a piece of french movie history a prime example of how you can watch a movie , think you're going to watch a pithy happy ending , and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end . definitely catch this movie . oh and while you're at , maybe not too near the same time , but down the road , take a look at wicker park , it'll surprise you too .",1,0
"remember greg the bunny ? it was this show that started on the independent film channel , but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox . my cousin and i thought it was pretty funny , beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on tv pg material . puppets who kill occurs in a similar universe , where puppets live in the same world as people , and like us , take on jobs and lives of their own . let's just say if you couldn't handle that , then don't bother watching pwk , as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of society's good graces through drug abuse , hedonism and violent felonies only to end up in a half way house . there's plenty of violence , sex , and bad language so it would never make its way to u . s . network tv . as if sociopathic puppets weren't enough , the fact that this takes place in canada makes it even more disturbing btw , the government pays for this , and i think any american television viewer would demand more demented cable tv fodder like this . i don't know where you can get it in the u . s . , beyond extra satellite tv , but i'd advise you give it a try . really funny stuff . it airs on the comedy network in canada",1,0

"another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batman dead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more ! this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like ! even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts . the attention to detail , character and action is undeniably real . although this is a limited resources production , it puts to shame big budgeted , star casted , hyped productions other superhero related movies . here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people . finally , a superman that actually looks super and looks like the real thing ! batman the way it should be , without the flashy rubber casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver . i just wish that some sensible warner bros . exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel . i don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd , i would never get tired of watching it . just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this . hope the bigwigs at marvel dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look . no more batman robin fiasco , or hulk , daredevil , etc . learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to reinvent the hero for the movie , just to have it bomb in theaters . mr . collora . we need more directors like you !",1,0

"this movie is probably for you . it had an overall meditative quality from the music , to the beautiful photography , and listening to the often clich things about life that andy goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots . if you're familiar with buddhism that is the sort of the sense i got out of this film . the impermanence of life , the beauty of nature , the interconnectedness of all things , etc . however , what i did not understand , confused , and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing i saw over an hour of it was the redundancy of the whole thing . you only find out bits and pieces of why he's commissioned , and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work . the art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends .",1,0

"the brain that wouldn't die was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962 . today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959 ; the thing is both lurid and lewd , but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way . the story , of course , concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab . with the aid of a few telephone cords , a couple of clamps , and what looks very like a shallow baking pan , he brings her head back to life . but is she grateful ? not hardly . in fact , she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing , particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body . as it happens , the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed , and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks , haunting strip joints , visiting body beautiful contests , and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow . but back at the lab , the head has developed a chemically induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments , this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet . can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance , wreck revenge upon the doctor , and save the woman whose body he hankers for ? could be ! leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of spanish fly ; virginia leith , the unhappy head , screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords . busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music , actors make irrational character changes from line to line , the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot , and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs . on the whole the brain that wouldn't die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie . director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip , and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors , who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it . the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost , but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release , and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with . now , this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious , depending on your point of view , so it is very hard to give a recommendation . but i'll say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers , you need to snap this one up and now ! four stars for its cheesy bizarreness alone ! gft , amazon reviewer",1,0

"one of the things that makes this ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing . shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out . this is what was known as british understatement . three instances a comic fight is edited like this . alec guiness has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry . half a dozen businessmen invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract relinquishing his control of the cloth so that production can be suppressed . when he catches on to this , guiness stands up and turns to walk to the door . two men block his way . excuse me , he says quietly , taking a step forward . the two men move between guiness and the camera . cut . a secretary is sitting outside at her desk . there is silence until the buzzer begins signaling her frantically . she takes up her notebook and opens the door to the inner office where a full fledged noisy donnybrook is in progress and the room is half wrecked . guiness dashes out the open door . the following example would be unthinkable today . during the research phase of his invention guiness sets up an elaborate chemical apparatus but instead of converting the experimental liquid into the new cloth , the device explodes . again and again it explodes . the laboratory is cleared of all other work . the blasts continue . ceilings fall down . windows are blown out . the director of research is seated at his desk in a tiny office cluttered with debris , a bandage on his head . when the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air . sit down , he tells his visitor , there's another one due at any moment . it is excruciatingly amusing and there is not a single shot of any explosions . this would be unimaginable now without a fireball , and maybe a building collapsing in slow motion . last example , consisting of a series of quick , relentless cuts , put together precisely . guiness is being pursued and is cornered in the lobby of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract . faced with two men about to grapple with him , guiness backs up with a determined expression . he bumps against a pedestal with an iron bust on it . the bust topples backward and bumps against the wall . there is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall . another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being jarred loose and falling down . quick cut to guiness's head rising into the frame . cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible brass banging and thudding sounds are heard off screen . cut to guiness flat on his back . nobody today would have the cojones to not show guiness being crowned by that shield . i won't go on with this . it's a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity . in solving one set of problems , guiness has created dozens of others . he is opposed both by management and labor , neither of which is shown to much advantage . and of course the economic implications have to do with more than cloth . what about that car that runs on water with a pinch of something or other in it ? one of the workers asks . vested interests , comments another worker , as thorstein veblen nods in his grave . what would happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight ? if i owned shares of exxon and i think i do i'd shudder at the thought . where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil ? for that matter , where would the police force and the fbi be if crime were to suddenly disappear ? this is a thoughtful and very amusing movie , superbly directed and edited . the roster of performers is peerless . joanne greenwood with that husky voice . the blithering cecil parker . the wheezing mummified ernest thesiger . a first rate job all around .",1,0
"i just saw this film last night at toronto film festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section . to tell you the truth , the only reason why i went for this movie was because it shared its name with the radiohead song , and also because my friend had bought the tickets so i really didn't have a choice d i went in expecting it to be something like the silence of the lambs , but it turned out to be semi gore flick . somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable , and that is absolutely correct . i really couldn't care less if potente's character got her entrails ripped out by the creep . i was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with potente's character getting her just desserts . christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film . however , the story is rather weak , but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively . the score by a bristol band called the insects was top notch . that , more than anything else , really scared the crap out of me . the director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the q a session . i really do hope he gets to make better films in the future . this one is strictly for genre fans , but i'd recommend non fans to give this a try anyway . it was a fun ride .",1,0

"this movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective , so i was hooked by the time the title came on . the theme of this movie is that everyone is acting , trying to re invent themselves , but not in a tricky way like identity or the usual suspects , but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting . the scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular . at one point jorgen who owns the chicken farm attends a seminar in laughing , where he's the worst student . his discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself . the movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people i see every day . there's not a lot of plot here . guessing the old man's secret is pretty easy , but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out . this movie appealed to me in the same way that sideways did , although the characters couldn't be more dissimilar .",1,0
"dressed to kill starts off with kate miller angie dickinson having a sexually explicit nightmare , later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr . robert elliott michael caine for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated unfulfilled in her current marriage . kate then visits a museum picks up a stranger , they go back to his apartment for casual sex , when done kate is set to leave but is attacked killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman . prostitute liz blake nancy allen discovers the gruesome scene sees the killer but manages to escape . detective marino dennis franz says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate's son peter keith gordon to track down the real killer , clear liz's name see that justice is done . written directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery . the script is measured slow at times but it likes to focus on the character's so you really know them , the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off , then the film switches it's attentions to liz no one else gets a look in . this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing engaging , unfortunately the character's themselves aren't exactly likable . i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times , especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally . the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill . it's a good film but it didn't excite me that much i didn't really find any character to root for or like . the film tacks on a needless unnecessary twist ending that i didn't really see the point of . director de palma directs with style visual flair , from the art museum sequence to a car chase as a whole it's impeccably filmed throughout . i'd imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it . i felt the film was a bit flat uninspired at times though , nothing about it really excited me that much . there is a fair bit of nudity , some sex rape along with a few bits of gore violence , kate's murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight , if that's the right word . however , it's by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe . with a supposed budget of about 6 , 500 , 000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film . the new york locations are nice , the cinematography is good as a whole it's extremely well made . i thought the music was inappropriate was far to loud intrusive . the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn't think caine had that much screen time . allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made , interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them , this blow out 1981 , he cast her as a prostitute . a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start . dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn't think it quite lived up to it's lofty reputation . good but not brilliant .",1,0

"i've seen a fair few films from the far east recently . some were excellent battle royale , infernal affairs , the eye , and some were not so great versus , the triple cross . then there are ones like uzumaki and returner , which while flawed i still enjoyed . the basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon a community . sound silly ? yeah , thats what i was thought . firstly , the good stuff . direction was top notch , sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish . secondly the story , was original and like other writers commented very lovelace esq . it was interesting . what it reminded me most of however was early cronenberg ; films like shivers and videodrome . the acting wasn't great , but not too horrible either . to be honest i was actually bored on a few occations . i felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow . my main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror , and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy . spoilers below . spoilers some good scenes washing machine and i liked the final shot voiceover . at first i thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later i realised the meaning and liked the end . however , because of the lack of seriousness in the story , combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that i did not care for the characters much in the end . the final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little poignent , while in reality i couldn't really care for the girl or her boyfriend . spoilers end so overall i kinda did like this film , but it frustrated me and i think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes . couple of other points , the main girl is quite pretty and cute , and the song that plays at the end is good too . i rated it 7 10 .",1,0
"those of the instant gratification era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film's pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count . the fact is , the empty acre is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done . if you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back story could have come off the back of a count chocula box , the empty acre is the movie for you . set in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream , the empty acre is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six month old baby . as the couple's weak relationship falls apart , a larger story plays out in the background . at night , a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path , leaving no sign that it was ever there . the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening , and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer director's faith in an intellectual audience . there seems to be a sub text concerning the death of the american dream , but i would hardly call the film an allegory . riveting , well acted , and technically astute , the empty acre is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love .",1,0

"this is a totally awesome movie ! if you haven't seen it yet , you damn well should . sure , the plot is slow to develop , the special effects are laughable , the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed , but as wrestler ddp would say ; that's not a bad thing . that's a good thing ! everything about this movie is hilarious , especially if you get the dubbed version , which has even worse actors . it's countless laughs until you get to the end , yearning for the sequel , where the mummy fights wrestling women . thus , i give it ten stars . unless you're one of those 'discriminating' and 'intelligent' people with good taste , who likes only 'high quality' films of the highest calibre , i recommend this utterly monkeydellic movie !",1,0
"first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in . 1995 . rappers were in it , and that added to the flair of it . remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't , until he met and was befriended by nazis . they took him in . nazi's aren't all this awkward , but like most gangs , they fill a void that is missing be it economic , social , emotional , whatever . michael rappaport played the part perfectly . omar epps was the hot shot track star , with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder . he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight , and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it . kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in , until she was date raped . she then found her self experiment with her sexuality , and getting involved politically . this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism , people's own perspectives come into play . i read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one nazis . so what ? remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all , he was trying to find his way , and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him . he was scared , it was sad to see him devolve how he did . he even says right before he kills himself , i didn't mean it , i wanted to be an engineer . ice cube and busta rhymes were angry black men , ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual , and busta rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug . they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates , and generally appear to not like white people very much . they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness . sorry if this makes it seem unfair , but are there really black groups like the nazis ? no . people say it shows white bad black good . not true , the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police , which is more or less true in real life . kristen was a good girl , her boyfriend omar epps roommate was a good guy , and even remy was a good guy , he was just misguided . omar epps , ice cube and busta were seriously flawed characters , angry and inconsiderate . although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger . remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well . good movie , well done . like all movies that deal with racism , its a great piece to get a discussion going . i don't think cube and busta coulda beat those nazis though .",1,0
"before i begin , let me tell you how great this stand up special sounds when you play sonic adventure i dx director's cut at the same time red mountain level in particular . so while watching this stand up special , i suggest no , demand you do it . carlos mencia takes his stand up to the extreme in san francisco , california . there , he makes fun of everybody with absolutely no apologies . i am pretty much thanking god here that carlos didn't do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over and over and over again . he does a tremendous job making fun of everyone and at the same time be truthful about it ; i know a couple of times i said , after carlos said a joke , damn , this guy makes a good point ! and then the game over screen came over my tv because i forgot i was playing sonic adventure i dx director's cut . my bad so yeah , there's nothing to complain about this stand up special . if you have tivo or something like that , please do yourself a favor and record this historic hour .",1,0
"one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun exciting for the cast and crew ; i could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm dedication because they apparently liked the people involved . i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart , and i think this is one such work . the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual , maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress director , and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent , watchable piece of art . the critiques of this film that more or less say , why not just rent a hardcore porn movie , make the point as to why they didn't like the film . going to this film hoping for a lot of t a without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them . one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie , even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn . i think she graduated . in terms of the writing , the dialog is not a huge part of the movie , like in a tarentino film , but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun . particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure , with the villianess heroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings . i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this . hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride . gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot , not just airhead bimbos , so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art , even with the limits of b movie land , not disappointing .",1,0
"this movie is the best horror movie i have ever seen . the acting is terrible and the plot leaves a lot to be desired but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks . seriously , if you have little kids don't let them see this . of course i am a little biased because of an irrational fear of puppets and midgets . also a body double cameo by the guy who does mini me verne troyer . and some gratuitous nudity , a must in any low budget horror movie . all other horror movies will forever be judged against this in my book .",1,0
"i admit i had some trepidation when i first saw the previews for this film . was vh 1 treading on hollow ground here ? i mean , harris and quinn don't really look or even sound like john or paul . but i have to admit , this film really surprised me . it's far from the exploitation film i expected . instead , it's a character study , a low key , whimsical , and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship , and the ultimate lesson we all learn it's hard , if not impossible , to capture what we once had , and what has passed us by .",1,0
"separate lies changed my life . actually , the q a did . spoilers below . read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it the emily watson character cheats on the tom wilkonson character . my first reaction to the puppy dog eyed emily was it's over . dump her . bad riddance . for some reason , he stuck around . not in a pathetic way . he just listened . and tried to accept her needs . at times he needed to leave . but he stuck by her and let her live her life . but i still wanted to see her afterwards , julian , the screenwriter and director , talked about the film . i'm glad he did , because frankly i am too you and was too immature to get the point before he broke it down for me . tom's character loved her , and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs might disagree with what he wants , he would always love her . the relationship and love they shared wasn't a lie , all of a sudden , just because she wanted to be with someone else . the fact that she wanted to be with someone else didn't make her who she was . when you get past fifty , there's a strong chance that finding the love of your life won't come around again , so you can't be as dismissive as you were when you were younger . you have to try and make things work , because the alternative may be much worse . she needed what she needed , and she couldn't help that . he had to learn to let go of her if he wanted to be the full man he could be . he helped her in pursuit of her lover , even when it hurt him . another thing julian said that the strongest tool of a controller is guilt . again the strongest tool of a controller is guilt . at the end of the film , tom released her from her burden . he felt a need to let her know that he loved her , but not to in order to get her back ; he wanted to let her know she didn't need to feel guilty or think poorly about the relationship , just because it ended in such a terrible way . it is not my way to review a film based on the message , rather than the execution , especially when i understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director , but i make an exception here , as i feel one more mature than i would benefit from seeing the film . the execution of the film making was a nice , british pace . rupert was slimy and revolting . tom and emily were their usually solid , real characters .",1,0
"i first saw this film when i was about 8 years old on tv in the uk where it was called laupta the flying island . i absolutely loved it , and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it . i was enchanted by the story and characters , but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music . it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw sometimes erroneously referred to as the streamline dub the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box set . unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney . the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the streamline dub or the original japanese had , and i think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead . they have made some pointless alterations , such as changing the main character's name from pazu to patzu , and added some dialogue . but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking , which i find annoying in many disney films . this film still blows away most recent animated films , and i cannot recommend it highly enough . the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass market , homogenized animation .",1,0
"okay , this wasn't the greatest horror movie i've ever seen in my life . despite the fact that it's lower budget , it's a pretty decent movie , though . the monsters are unique and believable . heck , they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family . although , when you finally do get to see the monsters completely , you really think wtf ! ? those itty bitty things are after them ? ! the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty ! not the kitty , noooooo , why ? seriously though , if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore , this is not the movie for you . go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines . if you have small children , i wouldn't recommend watching this with them though ; probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room .",1,0
"the movie actually has a fairly good story , but gets bogged down in several key places . it's almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film . dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role . but something is clearly missing from several key scenes . this 2 . 5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie . and probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together .",1,0

"i had been long awaiting this movie ever since i saw the trailer , which made it look like a political drama , starring three of my favorite actors ; al pacino , john cusack , and bridget fonda . and even though it was directed by harold becker , who has done uneven work , he and pacino did combine on sea of love , which ranks among each of their best work . but interference on some level for starters , several of the scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie and changing of tone subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller make this , while watchable , nowhere near as it could have been . which is too bad , because i really wanted to like this movie . there was great potential here to be a film about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption , and to make a complex statement about that corruption , not the usual good guys vs . bad guys . and there is good acting here . pacino and cusack are both very good , and danny aiello gives one of the best performances of his career . but fonda is wasted in her role , having nothing to do , and while there is merit in the central storyline , when it turns to a thriller , the movie loses its way , briefly recovers in the final scene between cusack and pacino , and then falls down completely in the end . i wish i could like this more , but no .",1,0
"i'm a fan of c c , going back to their records , and liked this movie , but at one point in the mid 1980's on cable television in san jose california , it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie . all references to marijuana were replaced with diamonds . the bag that red drops to chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana , but the conversation still remains the same . it's worth 3000 lb . there is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing c c , and talking to each other about getting the diamonds . at the end , instead of space coke , it's something else . i'm not sure who created this version , but it was horrible , and obvious that they were attempting to make it family child friendly . it would have been better if that network had not aired it at all .",1,0
"china o'brien 1990 was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states . this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse . sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director . the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms . rothrock and richard norton . if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight to video action flick . china o'brien returns home to help out her dad . he's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help . so she returns home and restores order with the help of two unlikely people . but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies ? if you're a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you . i only enjoyed the fighting scenes , everything else is rubbish . why didn't raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director ? recommended .",1,0
"i must say , i thought i had seen it all . i am an extremely jaded movie buff . this movie didn't shock me , by any means . i'm way past that point . but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn't know i could go to . i had no idea i could ever find ick the idea of beastiality erotic . never never never . ever . ever . but there you go . he did it . i have to give the director credit . he pulled it off . for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore . we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex . after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn't a mistake . then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married . then some nervous guy shaves . then we see briefly a hot chick getting it on with a butler but this is very brief . at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake . in fact , i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night . we finally get the good stuff when a girl who knows who she is , or who anyone is in this movie has a dream about a victorian era gal being ravaged by a beast thing in the forest . the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat heh heh of the whole deal . it's beautifully shot , superbly edited , and does deliver the goods . they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn't either . oh well . i would definitely recommend this film . the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself and my tv but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it .",1,0
"after all the crap that hollywood and the indies have churned out , we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments . there are some clich d moments , but i'm not sure it's possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie . there's not much new here . it's just done well . make sure and pay attention , as the subtle scares come quickly and often . this is not a movie to watch while you're eating pizza . there's one very well written red herring in this movie and , unfortunately , one very poorly cast role . cheri christian just doesn't make an effective julie the wife mother . for one thing , she's totally unsympathetic . i know , i know . she's just gone through a traumatic experience . but the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting in an unintentional way . i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her , but i never did . finally , a thumbs up for the ending , which is both disturbing and satisfying . it could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits , but the director wisely resisted . this is not a masterpiece by any means , but it is a good , old fashioned scary movie . something that's rather rare nowadays .",1,0
"three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another . the one hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over . i have seen other segments of the dekalog but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure . the film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder . obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen at least in the short 1 hr version of dekalog 5 . we are made to imagine that this must have been the case . a cab driver who is a misanthrope , has two facets to his character the good side feeds a mangy dog , cleans his cab meticulously , picks up dirty rags thrown by people who lack civic sense , and remembers his wife while dying ; the bad side frightens small poodles , refuses to give a ride to a drunk probably worried that he will puke in the cab and ogles at pretty girls . the repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy , drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic , and pushes strangers into urinals without any provocation , is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh . kieslowski's film and the script thus present the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters . yet the film is not about capital punishment but more a treatise on killing . the fifth commandment thou shalt not kill is explored theologically even god spared cain . ' , sociologically the tenderness of brutes to children and poor forlorn dogs , and psychologically after effects of drunken night with a male friend that led to the accidental death of his sister , whose photograph he carries with him . what makes ordinary persons turn into killers this is never fully explained but suggestions are legion . in kieslowski's world there is a pattern where events and people are interlinked in a cosmic sense note the resemblance of clown to the killer , as it hangs from the mirror in the cab . kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to ask us to look at the commandment literally and figuratively why do we kill ? are the people legally killed truly bad ? is there a force beyond society the drunken night that led to life of a girl that makes us into abhorrent murderers ? it would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two detailed killings in the film both without mercy . the film invites the viewer to contemplate why we are asked by god not to kill . i understand a longer full length version of the film was made by kieslowski . but even this short 1 hr version is superb with its bleak and sparse script , intelligent editing , interesting cinematography and top notch direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts . this segment anticipates the more wholesome dekalogs 6 , 7 and 8 .",1,0
"this 1955 producers' showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of showcasing most of the original broadway cast , including kathleen nolan as wendy , who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color televised play . it's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production which doesn't even show up in the imdb listings when you put peter pan into the search engine ! is superior to the cutesier color version most people have watched . i obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally . now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison . i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b w producers' showcase televised version . as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening promo . how far away the 1950's seem now such an innocent time compared to today . i miss it .",1,0

"rko radio pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to get it nominated for the best picture academy award . the acting , script , continuity , et cetera , are all just about perfect ; and the story is well worth the viewer's 82 minutes . although the picture soft petals the true life story by making the murder victim a jew rather than a homosexual , most viewers will see the victim as a jewish homosexual such disguises never work , perhaps weren't intended to . i could nit pick about a few details , but just for fun . there was no all night movie house in washington , dc in 1947 and if there was i wish robert mitchum and his pal wouldn't talk through the show . there weren't any bars where a gi could pick up a pretty blonde . none ! if robert ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop he ought to have bought the daily news ; not the times hearald , evening star and certainly not the know nothing washington post . but these little things take nothing away from this classic . the film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of a musical score , except during the credits . i've only seen this done in a few films . on the negative side , since 1995 it comes with a tmc introduction where some liberal blabs about what the public was ready for in 1947 . blah , blah , blah ! as if this fool has any business judging his betters . i'd say the ex gi's in 1947 the greatest generation were much smarter and had better values than some commentator , film historian , or other wise mouth in 1995 . put a sock in it !",1,0

"comanche moon had everything going for it . for starters , simon wincer's back , a man who's name is synonymous with high quality tv westerns . unfortunately , the problems with moon are something even the most talented director couldn't solve a poor script based on a lackluster novel . forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you , the biggest travesty in moon is that it's not even consistent with information from the original lonesome dove masterpiece . so many wonderful , rich moments in the miniseries and , to an even greater degree , the book , are completely missing in moon . considering the fact that most viewers of moon are probably coming with at least some sort of dove background , the lack of character driven and emotional backstory is downright painful . that said , moon is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen . for example , the novel moon focuses largely on the comanches themselves . to its credit , the miniseries tries to service the comanches , but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story . similarly , val kilmer's scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so kilmer and rachel griffiths , for that matter actually had something to do , or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller , supporting parts . instead , kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act . there's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book a killer parrot ? what ? further , there isn't a single scene that shows us that call and mccrae are anything near the amazing texas rangers they claim to be . not a single one of their expeditions in moon or dead man's walk , for that matter ends successfully , and call and mccrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another . frankly , larry mcmurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script , and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie , brokeback mountain . mcmurtry can write good novels although there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement , but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter . this production would have benefited from not only bringing back director wincer , but original screenwriter bill wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen . witcliff doesn't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit , but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original lonesome dove . with all this said , comanche moon is almost a brilliant production , aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do . steve zahn's portrayal of gus mccrae or rather , his portrayal of robert duvall as gus mccrae is dead on . and while some have criticized karl urban as woodrow call , saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet , stoic woodrow of the original movie , all i can say is blame mcmurtry , because mcmurtry is the one who both in the moon novel and now the miniseries turned woodrow from socially inept , awkward , but natural leader , into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel . still , it's the cast that sparkles in moon , to the degree that i left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy i felt watching the original lonesome dove this time because i realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long , long time to come and quite honestly , this cast could have done so well in a well nurtured , full blown network tv series . all in all , aside from wasted opportunities with the cast , the biggest travesty is that the original lonesome dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating , utterly fascinating , to see translated on screen . unfortunately , all that has been tossed aside in favor of mcmurtry's tedious , inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant , prequel .",1,0

"the very few reviews i could find online of barnens really do not do it justice . i read them all before ordering the dvd , but for some reason i ordered it anyway . i regretted it almost immediately , but the order had already gone through so i couldn't cancel it . i'm very glad now that i couldn't . it's an extraordinary movie . i won't give a synopsis of the plot , because other reviewers have already done that . but i will say that i don't understand comments that it's bleak , shocking , weird , clinical , depressing or pornographic . it is certainly very unusual , which i suppose could make it seem weird to some people , but the other criticisms must reflect the reviewers' own issues , because i didn't see any of that in the movie i just watched . i'm not attracted to boys , so the nudity didn't seem pornographic at all to me it's just a kid trying to figure out who he is with no help at all from the irresponsible adults in his life . and it's sweden , not utah , so topless women are no big deal . but what surprised me most is how positive the movie is in its depiction of this gutsy lost kid who goes on a sort of odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences , looking for and ultimately finding himself . it's fascinating , thoroughly original , and deeply satisfying . i'm not at all surprised that barnens won three major guldbagge awards , for best film , direction , and actor , but i'm absolutely astounded that the actor who won was not tomas fryk , the kid whose fearless performance as reine must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed , but ingvar hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of stig , reine's mother's sleazy boyfriend . i don't understand that at all , but it doesn't alter the fact that this is a great movie .",1,0
"for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart , this is one of his lesser films from later in his career . and , while it isn't a great film compared to many of his other pictures , it isn't bad and is a decent time passer but not much more . kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason , she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her . over time , the cold and detached ms . novak also begins to fall in love with stewart and apparently in the witch's rule book , this is a definite no , no ! the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches . they are neither the baby sacrificing nor the all powerful variety . most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps . and , very oddly , the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz . considering what i think of jazz , it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world ! anyway , the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic , but not something i would rush out to watch . the acting is pretty good , but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film in fact , i almost scored the film a 6 it was really close .",1,0
"it's hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does . she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress . that notwithstanding , yes , the plot was predictable . i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was , which would have added more to the suspense . it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richard's little problem with his ex wife , maybe a bit more back story . i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie . i would have liked to have seen more closure with zack's death and possibly closure with her husband . i do have to say though , i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there . it was a very fitting end for richard . of course , mitzi rocked ! i am so looking forward to her future projects .",1,0

"for the record , i am a curly fan through and through . but i do have to say that in reality , shemp wasn't really that bad . yeah , he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that curly had , but in his own way he was hilarious . at least he wasn't as bad as joe besser . in brideless groom , shemp plays a music professor stooge ? a professor ? yeah right , who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle , and moe larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six o'clock that night , or no money . this was one of the stooges' first skit with shemp , before they started recycling their material . perhaps it isn't surprising that shemp was part of the stooges before curly came into the picture , so he seemed natural at this . the slapstick gags are hilarious , especially this one scene with moe and shemp in a phone booth . essential stooge short to be honest .",1,0
"i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod . if you don't expect anything else , such as clever plot twists and believable character development , you won't be disappointed . consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people , especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy' suzanna arquette , who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten she leaves that up to her daughter . mandy's face is a little too perfect , but her body is a complete 5 alarm fire , up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness , a perfect 7 to 10 ratio of waist to hips , and splendidly configured legs , right down to her feet . there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye ; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio . and no flat butt to boot , which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres' . mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle lit hot tub with her blindfolded german guy victim no . 2 , but from all i could see from her bikini shots , she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it . mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl' , with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones . her bisexual nature allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no . 2 , who also happened to be her mother's lover added an additional dimension to an otherwise one dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses always by water with the men the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason . mandy's uber nordic facial features coupled with her uber voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse . if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress , i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages , especially italian and spanish and maybe french , although i don't know if they would go for her type . but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body but maybe her face is just a little too nordic , and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground . vambo drule .",1,0
"honestly , i was expecting to hate this one , and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it . but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed . a group of college kids and their teacher go on a field trip to ireland . their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace . the group of post teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods but being the stupid b movie characters that they are of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one by one . first off , there is plenty wrong with evil breed . the acting dialog is pretty weak , and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson , chasey lain , ginger lynn , and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here and jenna's role in this production is grossly over hyped , as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time . even less with chasey , and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever . also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film . those gripes aside there is some good stuff as well . richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on , with greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey's guts hanging out from being torn in half though how she ends up this way isn't shown on screen . not bad for the first 5 minutes . the other kill scenes are pretty inventive , including jenna's forced breast implant removal , a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass , a knife through the face , and a few other notables . the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em , so to speak . also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored . the creature fx are also done competently which definitely helps . overall , evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected . this one , along with satan's little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low budget straight to video films . i usually steer clear of them as a whole , but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith . evil breed is no masterpiece , but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it i know i was , and i'm sure it didn't hurt the experience . 7 . 5 10",1,0

"i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th , knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy adventure quest of some sort . the plot line really is nothing like i have seen , and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters . in spite of what first impressions may give , it isn't cheesy , corny , tacky , or ridiculous , and is actually highly entertaining and funny . the flow is quite well done , nothing seems rushed or dragged out . the soundtrack , for lack of better words , is magical and adds much to the film , as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv . and even though i might have known what was coming at points , i still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen ; to my knowledge , not a single person left the theater during the entire movie . my one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film , and as brilliant as it is i can't figure out why .",1,0

"no matter how much it hurts me to say this , the movie is not as good as it could have been . maybe i was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews here on imdb , but i expected so much more . sure , the idea is a good one , the violent scenes and the camera work are outstanding , the imagination of genius dario is breathtaking , but the movie is soiled by a couple of mistakes that i find unforgivable . first of all , am i one of the few people who feel that the heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere apart ? with a different kind of music goblin ? during the needle scenes , it would have been soooo intense ! . instead , the soundtrack destroys any chance for tension . secondly , the final killing scene and the last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired . i don't want to say amateurish , cause i love argento's movies . the ending left me feeling empty . talk about a final impression ! this is hardly what happens in most of dario's films ! though , admittedly , suspiria also suffers from a rushed finale even if most of it is brilliant . in short , watch this movie , try to make the most of its good points , but be prepared for some bad ones as well . this is not a perfect movie by any means .",1,0

"yes i am a ff7 fan , but how many people who watch this movie are not going to be ? and so , i'm reviewing this movie from a ff7 fan perspective , and with no regret . i would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who has not played the ff7 game . visuals 10 10 i loved advent children . it's a sensory delight a complete audio video overload . the visuals were breathtaking some feats were accomplished that i would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature . when the action scenes came about , they were , for lack of a more accurate word , a roller coaster . with dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range , to seamlessly integrated bullet time effects at the crucial moments , to the sheer level of detail it's all hard to fault . the animation looks big budget , the style and imagery is awesome , and the effects at times made me forget that i was watching animation rather than live action footage . i could ramble on for hours repeating myself on the fantastic quality of the visuals , but it simply wouldn't do it any justice . sound 10 10 the sound was fabulous . the voices for all the characters didn't disappoint no one sounded silly and the sound effects were bold and sharp . the music from the game that in my opinion had the best game soundtrack ever , transfered beautifully to the movie . most of the memorable themes from the game are present in the movie , albeit often using different instruments to fit in better with what's going on . there was some bolder rock and slight thrash metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time , but it all fitted in well with the movie's situation at the corresponding time . story 7 10 the story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie . both aspects were simply not up to par with the game but then again , the game could spend 40 hours developing these points the movie only has about 90 minutes . as far as the story goes , the plot wasn't bad or anything , but just not as ambitious as was expected from someone who played the game through . in effect , the plot seemed rather weak in comparison . the game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and story progression development , that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league . instead , the movie took the more sensible approach to expand on the action and try to place as many inside jokes and themes into itself instead of trying to impossibly recreate the massive story factor , which was originally such a driving force in the game . the lack of materia usage also caused me some controversy the story of the movie chose to use little though not zero materia , and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill . i would hope that if a sequel was made it would incorporate materia much much more extravagantly and importantly into the film . there were also many plot holes in the movie all which can be forgiven if you think of advent children as a random anime , but seem ridiculous when you realise how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well . characters 7 10 the characters , whilst all being present in one form or another , don't necessarily shine to their true potential . there simply isn't really enough movie time to spend with all of them . and so , all of their background stories and abilities are not entirely showcased , and in some cases , barely at all red and cait sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions . even cloud , who is the focal point of the movie , i feel doesn't use enough of his familiar abilities from the game . the materia issue is a strong reason for this . with that said , it's a joy to see the cast back in action , even if it's in such a role that doesn't utilise them to their fullest . the new characters were the ones that caused me most of the strife however the bad guy trio and the kid dude denzel there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them . anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and be done with it , but objectively speaking the issue is still there to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing . value 10 10 the replay value for this movie is excellent i personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and louder way bigger screen , louder volume . enjoyment 10 10 whatever the flaws of the movie , they simply weren't big enough to hinder my enjoyment of it , and i honestly think that will be the same case for most people . i enjoyed advent children tremendously , and encourage fellow ff7 fans to go see it .",1,0

"this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say , enough already ! of course , it isn't nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes . eric phillips don wilson is an undercover cop in the near future . when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look a like cyborg , it is up to eric to clear her name . wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger . why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me . being a pm production , there are tons of car chases , exploding cars 4 in the first 5 minutes ! and shoot outs . i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck . my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don's simulator . it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa 1995 .",1,0
"why a good actress like elizabeth berkley stars in this commonplace movie ? ! the cast gives some good performance elizabeth berkley as a barbie girl , ele keats as a girl without mother and justin whalin , a guy eternally lessened by his bother , but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original . i can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen ! julie corman the producer are you crazy ? !",1,0
"stupid , stupid , stupid . i think that angelina jolie is probably one of the most talented actress' today , but a movie like this isn't just worth her time . she deserves better , and so does everyone else in this movie . talent is just wasted . sorry , but i don't feel like writing a review for this . i give it no stars out of .",1,0
"this movie has to be my favorite of all time . its not supposed to have a plot , because its makers wanted people charlie sheen , i think to believe it was a real snuff film . this was an exercise in visual effects , and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does . movies these days are now all about sound effects , leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood . there still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing . there is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film . have you seen the hills have eyes 2 ? the rape scene was funny instead of shocking . although i'm sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror . but since they probably suck at making films , they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off . the movie baise moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks . its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all , especially when talking about an ao or nc 17 rating . i'm sure eli roth has the ability talent to make his hostel film series much much better , but he has too tame it down to get an r rating . or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations . watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident crime scenes footage . don't forget that this movie was made in 1985 . the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film . that would be like someone saying the 8bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps3 has better graphics .",1,0
"i know it was supposed to be a long walk , but really ! the costumes were a bit yuk , but still . it was the 1970's i suppose ! it was a bit long and dull , so give me the newer version any day !",1,0
"go way back to page ten of this review section , and work your way back up . go ahead ; i'll wait . done ? well , then you've probably noticed the same trend that i have . you could nitpick all day long about the lame jokes , dated timing and obviously derivative plot points and shtick in 'bogus' , but this movie seems to be one of those 'hate me now , love me later flicks . bill and ted's biggest problem was that the original appealed to those 80's kids who followed the tends and considered themselves on the cutting edge of fashion . that worked fine for the original , but obviously bombed in 1991 , when no self unrespecting slacker would be caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting he liked anything about the 80's . as ted would put it dude , this is a totally deep hole . wanna play 20 questions ? they say nostalgia goes in 20 year cycles , and that certainly seems to be the case here . here in 2010 , those of use who grew up with cindi lauper and megadeth are beginning to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that like it or not made us who we are . if you're one of those who look at 'bogus' as if it were an outdated fa gs ! ripoff , then you're missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair , wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed . in self referencing its own origins the star trek episode and and time traveling with a phone booth , b t makes no attempt to hide its creators' love for homage . quentin tarantino , anyone ? i'm not saying 'bogus' is 'true love , ' but i do think it needs to be appreciated for what it is a fun snap shot of our society at a time before child psychology , ritalin , anti smoking ads , terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media fear mongering . so , for all of you b t haters out there . turn off your screaming trees cd , get that hair out of your face , go to the beach and lighten up . narcissistic depression and intellectual ennui are so corporate .",1,0
